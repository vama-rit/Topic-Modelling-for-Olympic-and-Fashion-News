  "body": "Team USA may have lost a key contributor just five months ahead of the 2022 Beijing Winter Games. Reigning Olympic luge silver medalist Chris Mazdzer broke his right foot during a preseason training run on Thursday, bringing his availability for the Games into question. Mazdzer told the AP he will \"need some time\" to determine whether he can compete at an Olympic level by February. \"I knew something was wrong right away since I couldn't put any pressure on my foot, and imaging confirmed that I broke my foot in a few places,\" said Mazdzer, who competed on season 26 of the Dancing Stars. \"After investing physically, mentally and financially for this Olympic year, the game plan changed in just the matter of a few seconds,\" he added. Mazdzer told the AP his foot broke after it slammed into a piece of ice while traveling over 75 mph. The 33-year-old was practicing with a few of his American teammates at the 2014 Olympic track in Krasnaya Polyana, Russia prior to the injury. Mazdzer, a three-time Olympian, competed on that very track during the 2014 Games. The absence of Mazder would be a major hit to USA Luge, which is counting on him to compete in both the doubles and singles events. Mazder, the only World Cup-level luger to compete in both disciplines, won a silver medal at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games in the singles event. Mazdzer's doubles partner Jayson Terdiman is confident Mazdzer can return to his pre-injury form in time to defend his medal. \"Over the last three years, we have overcome numerous injuries and still come back stronger,\" Terdiman said. \"I believe this instance will be no different. Chris and I are both mentally tough, and we know how to get through anything. ... Neither of us has been deterred from the end goal, putting Team USA on the podium in Beijing.\" After beginning its training in Russia, USA Luge is set to continue those preparations in China this fall. The 2022 Winter Games will take place Feb. 4-20 in Beijing.",

One of which was that no fans were allowed to attend event. Similar protocols will also be in place for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. On Wednesday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) gave an update on the upcoming Winter Games, including their policy for fans. In their release, the IOC stated that only people in China will be able to attend the games. Here's the IOC's entire statement on the matter: \"Tickets will be sold exclusively to spectators residing in China's mainland, who meet the requirements of the COVID-19 countermeasures. Specific requirements on COVID-19 countermeasures for spectators from China's mainland and the details of ticketing arrangements are under discussion and development, and will be released to the public in due course once they are finalised.\" While it's unfortunate, especially for fans that aren't from China, this is a step up from the Tokyo Olympics, where no fans were allowed due to an increase in Japan's COVID-19 cases that coincided with the dates of the games. On top of the fan policy, the IOC is taking the extra measure of making life easier for athletes who are vaccinated against COVID-19. \"All athletes and Games participants who are fully vaccinated will enter the closed-loop management system upon arrival. Games participants who are not fully vaccinated will have to serve a 21-day quarantine upon arrival in Beijing.\" There will also be COVID-19 testing in place at the Games.",

  "body": "Two-time Olympic gold medalist Klete Keller pleaded guilty to a felony charge stemming from his participation in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. The 39-year-old swimmer agreed to obstructing an official proceeding -- one of seven criminal charges he incurred in February, but prosecutors dropped the other six -- and can resultantly face up to 27 months in prison. Prosecutors claimed Keller wore a Team USA jacket during the riot, stayed in the Capitol for an hour and yelled expletives about Democratic party congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Those actions amounted to obstructing an official proceeding charge, one that has a recommended sentence of 21 to 27 months in prison. U.S. district judge of the District of Columbia Richard Leon, who presided over Keller's case and will later sentence him, is not limited to that range. Over 600 people, including Keller, have been charged for their actions in the January attack on the Capital. The rioters injured 140 police officers, according to the Capitol Police Officers' union. Keller, a Phoenix native and former USC star, appeared in three Olympics (2000, 2004, 2008) and won five medals. He's best known for anchoring the men's 800m free relay team in 2004, when the Americans gave the Australians their first loss at the international level in seven years. The Reno-Gazette Journal named him the most decorated Nevada-born Olympian ever in 2015.",

USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland announced all staff, athletes and facility workers are required to get their shots by Nov. 1 if they haven't already, in preparation for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. USOPC personnel must show proof of vaccination by Dec. 1, but exemptions will be awarded in certain medical and religious circumstances. Hirshland said the vaccination requirement will continue into every Olympic and Paralympic event going forward. No other American sports league has a COVID-19 vaccination mandate, although the NHL -- which will begin sending players to the Olympics ahead of Beijing 2022 -- enacted strict protocols such as allowing teams to suspend unvaccinated players if they miss time. The New York Islanders illustrated how serious the league is taking COVID-19 by banning an unvaccinated minor-leaguer from playing for the team. The International Olympic Committee along with most other national Olympic committees -- including the USOPC -- recommended but didn't require athletes participating in the 2020 Tokyo Games to get vaccinated. Still, the USOPC said 83% of its athletes were vaccinated while the IOC estimated 85% overall had their shots. \"The stark reality is that this pandemic is far from over,\" Hirshland wrote in a letter obtained by the Associated Press. \"This step will increase our ability to create a safe and productive environment for Team USA athletes and staff, and allow us to restore consistency in planning, preparation and service to athletes.\" Team USA plans to send nearly 240 athletes to the 2022 Winter Olympics, which are scheduled to start Feb. 4 and will likely have testing and social-distancing requirements akin to the ones Tokyo implemented for the Summer Games.",

  "body": "One of the most decorated swimmers in Olympic history is headed for new waters: the Swamp. Katie Ledecky, a 10-time Olympic medalist with seven golds, announced Wednesday she'll serve as a volunteer swimming coach at the University of Florida while training for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Gainesville. At Florida the 24-year-old Ledecky will reunite with Gators swimming coach Anthony Nesty, who served on Team USA's staff during the Tokyo Games. \"The knowledge and experience that Katie brings to the pool are unparalleled,\" Nesty said in a statement. \"In addition to her obvious excellence as a swimmer, Katie is an exceptional person who will make a great impact on the student-athletes here. Katie's values are in total alignment with the Florida program, and we're so excited to have her join the Gators as she continues to train for the 2024 Olympics.\" Ledecky, who earned her bachelor's degree in psychology from Stanford during June's Olympic Trials, brings a wealth of college experience and success to the Gators' staff. In only two years of collegiate swimming Ledecky won eight individual NCAA championships and powered the Cardinal to consecutive NCAA and Pac-12 titles from 2017-18. The three-time Olympian has dominated the international stage as much as college, winning the most medals of any female Team USA athlete in her last two appearances at the Games. Ledecky's seven gold medals in Olympic individual events are the most ever by a female Team USA athlete. \"I'm excited to be a part of the University of Florida's world-class swimming and diving program and train for the 2024 Olympics with Coach Anthony Nesty, and the top-tier mid-distance and distance training group,\" said Ledecky, who also cited Gainesville's proximity to her home in Maryland as a reason for the move. \"My years at Stanford, both academically and athletically, were nothing short of incredible and I'm looking forward to the opportunity and challenges that lie ahead in Gainesville.\" Ledecky has spent the last five years training at her alma mater under Team USA coach Greg Meehan. She'll now work with a 1988 Olympic gold medalist in Nesty and fellow Olympic medalists Bobby Finke and Kieran Smith, and she's amped for the challenge to compete with the men. \"I think I always benefit from training with the guys,\" Ledecky told USA Today, \"so I'll be able to do that very consistently down in Florida with athletes who have similar goals that I do to compete on the international level in those events. They have a very deep group of male distance and mid-distance swimmers and I'm really excited about that.\" Ledecky won't be the only Olympic superstar in Florida's pool. Fellow American Caeleb Dressel, a seven-time Olympic gold medalist who won a school-record 10 NCAA Championships with the Gators, also trains in Gainesville under coach Gregg Troy.",

  "body": "United States Olympic gymnasts Simone Biles and Aly Raisman were on hand on Wednesday to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee that FBI agents need to be held accountable for mishandling the investigation into former Team USA doctor Larry Nassar. According to a recent report published by the Department of Justice's inspector general, FBI agents didn't act with \"seriousness and urgency\" regarding reports of Nassar and his misconducts. The report found that FBI agents mishandled evidence and even made false statements to investigators relating to the case. \"It truly feels like the FBI turned a blind eye to us,\" Biles told the Senate on Wednesday. She added that the FBI agents in question need to be prosecuted and held fully accountable for their lack of action. Biles also questioned why the Department of Justice hasn't already handed out criminal charges to these FBI agents. During Wednesday's hearing, senators stated that a Justice Department official declined to speak regarding the investigation. Raisman informed the senators that it took 14 months for FBI agents to speak to her after the initial report of Nassar's sexual misconduct in 2015. That means that for more than a year after the initial report, Nassar was permitted to see patients. Dozens of young women were sexually assaulted during that time period. \"Why would duly sworn officers ignore reports of abuse across state lines?\" Raisman asked on Wednesday. Fellow American gymnast McKayla Maroney, like Raisman, brought up the timeline. \"By not taking action from my report they (the FBI) allowed a child molester to go free for more than a year. They had legal evidence of child abuse and did nothing,\" Maroney stated in her testimony. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz and FBI Director Christopher Wray also testified on Wednesday. Wray did acknowledge that the FBI agents were in the wrong and said that there were \"fundamental errors that occurred in 2015 and 2016 that should never have happened.\" Wray informed the senators that the FBI was altering its processes in order to make sure that a failure of this magnitude never happens again. When the first complaints were brought to the FBI's attention in 2015, Wray wasn't leading the FBI at that time. \"I'm deeply and profoundly sorry,\" Wray said \"...I'm especially sorry that there were people at the FBI who had their own chance to stop this monster in 2015 and failed. It never should have happened. And we're doing everything in our power to make sure it never happens again.\" Nassar is currently serving a 60-year prison sentence for child pornography charges, which is from police finding that material on his property in September 2016. In addition, Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in Michigan state court. That added 175 years to his prison sentence.",

This comes after United States track star Sha'Carri Richardson was disqualified from the Tokyo Olympics as a result of testing positive for marijuana use -- which she admitted using following the death of her mother. In a statement, WADA stated that the agency received many requests from \"a number of stakeholders\" asking to look further into the status of cannabis as a banned substance. This review will take place in 2022 and be conducted by the Prohibited List Expert Advisory Group within WADA. Until then, cannabis will still be banned in competition. The earliest that will change will be in 2022 after the review is over. In 2011, the WADA published a paper that stated that marijuana is banned because cannabis \"could potentially endanger\" athletes \"and others because of increased risk taking, slower reaction times and poor executive function or decision making.\" WADA also believes that cannabis can be \"performance enhancing\" for athletes. However, a 2018 study that was published in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine determined that there \"is no direct evidence of performance-enhancing effects in athletes.\" Richardson used marijuana in Oregon, a state where the substance is legal, after learning about the death of her biological mother. That was just weeks before the start of the Tokyo Olympics.",

  "body": "Long-distance runner Paul Chelimo became Team USA's first two-time Olympic medalist in the 5,000-meter event last month in Tokyo. But while Chelimo calls earning the medal an \"honor,\" the 30-year-old admits the Games were \"very intense\" and \"took a lot out of\" him. Chelimo's exhaustion was evident when he collapsed through the end line to finish just a fraction of a second ahead of Kenya's Nicholas Kipkorir Kimeli. The 40th annual New Balance Fifth Avenue Mile will be Chelimo's biggest step toward returning to form while also preserving his body. Chelimo will compete against 13 Tokyo Olympians, two Olympic medalists and two past event champions in the race slated for Sept. 12 in New York. \"I can't think of any road race in the world bigger than the Fifth Avenue Mile,\" said Chelimo, who'll be competing in first one-mile race since 2018. \"It's going to be on the weekend, it's always live on the TV, it's always in New York City -- and I know a lot of people in New York love running. So, that's where I want to be at this time. It should be fun being a part of it and it's hopefully not the last one. \"The goal is I hope I come back with a win.\" Chelimo has two motivating factors for the race. The first, meeting increasingly-high expectations from his fans and sponsors, has been around since he began running professionally. The second, however, is two years old and has given him a \"different drive.\" That second motivating factor is Arianna Chebet Chelimo, Chelimo's first child. \"When I go out there, I grind because she's got to live a better life,\" Chelimo said. \"She's got to have the best life.\" Chelimo wants his daughter to have the best life largely because his own -- prior to moving from Kenya to the U.S. to run collegiately in 2010 -- was far from it. In the 11 years since Chelimo's nearly 10,000-mile journey from his hometown of Itan, Kenya to the U.S., he's adopted the saying \"go hard or suffer the rest of your life.\" The words are ubiquitous across Chelimo's social media. Chelimo's mother instilled that \"go hard\" way of life into him as a child, and it's helped build him into the two-time Olympic medalist the world knows today. \"You always have to work hard for the best things,\" Chelimo said. \"And me coming to the U.S., it was really life-changing, and that's why I believe in 'go hard or suffer the rest of your life.' The United States is a land of opportunities and this is a place where, if you work really hard, everything is going to fall in place.\" \"I just have to go hard,\" he added. \"That's what I go with. The way I grew up, the only way I could get out of poverty and a tough life is just with my running. Running saved me.\" Running in the U.S. may have saved Chelimo, but he handsomely repaid the favor to his new country. Chelimo enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2014 and served as a water-treatment specialist. He gained U.S. citizenship just ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics for his service. The Army -- including its Word Class Athlete Program, which trains Olympic hopefuls such as Chelimo -- gave him a new mentality. A more respectful, humble, resilient and tough mentality. It's a mentality he carries into every race. \"You got to be resilient, you got to be tough,\" Chelimo said. \"And they teach you that, when you go to war, be ready to die for your country. So, that's the same way I feel when I wear the United States singlet. I feel like I'm representing the military in a different type of way.\" Chelimo's next big goal requires him to represent Team USA again. He's hoping to earn gold -- at age 38 -- in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Belief, Chelimo says, is what he's relying on to reach that goal. Belief has also gotten Chelimo to thrive after moving across the ocean, serving his country, succeeding at the Olympic level and providing for his daughter. As long as Chelimo goes hard, he's confident that trend will continue. \"If I win gold in the United States, in L.A., that's really, really [bigger] than winning gold in any other type of Olympics,\" Chelimo said. \"...That would be a dream come true.\"",

But Zolkefli's hopes were dashed after he ended up being disqualified for arriving late to the event. Three minutes late, to be exact. International Paralympics Committee Spokesman Craig Spence\u00a0told the Associated Press that Zolkefli arrived three minutes late to the event along with two other Malaysian competitors. \"They were late, they may have had a logical reason for being late, and therefore we allowed them to compete and look at the facts of the matter afterward,\" Spence said. World Para Athletics, which is the governing body for track and field Paralympics events, revealed that a referee determined \"there was no justifiable reason for the athletes' failure to report\" on time to the event. Zolkefli appealed the decision, but it was denied. As a result of the disqualification, Ukraine's Maksym Koval won the gold medal while Ukraine's Oleksandr Yarovyi earned the silver medal. Greece's Efstratios Nikolaidis took home the bronze medal. \"We are now seeing comments on all our social media posts that have nothing to do with the men's shot put F20 event,\" Spence said. \"I'm sorry.

  "body": "U.S. Paralympic swimmers Anastasia Pagonis and Gia Pergolini, both 17, each claimed gold in world record-breaking fashion on Thursday. Pagonis won America's first gold medal of the Tokyo Paralympics in the women's S11 400-meter freestyle while Pergolini placed first in the S13 100-meter backstroke. The first-time Paralympians can bask in their medal-winning glory together, as they've become fast friends while rooming together in Tokyo. \"I remember waking up this morning and [Pagonis] was like, 'This is the day, Gia. You got this,'\" Pergolini told NBC after her race. \"And I said, 'You got this too.' And we just love each other and love supporting each other.\" The Paralympians' mutual support led to two record-shattering performances. Pagonis broke the world record she set herself at the U.S. Paralympic Swimming Trials with a time of 4:54:49, 10 seconds faster than the silver medalist Lissette Bruinsma of the Netherlands. Pergolini broke her event's world record twice within a 10-hour span, first in her preliminary heat with a 1:05.05 and then again in the final with a 1:04.64. \"I'm so excited we're able to be here and we're both world-record holders,\" Pagonis, who completely lost her sight to genetic retina disease and autoimmune retinopathy at age 14, told the Olympic Information Service. Pagonis is competing in the S11 class, which is for Paralympians with the greatest visual impairments. Pergolini -- who began losing her sight to Stargardt disease as a kindergartener -- is classified as an S13 Paralympian, meaning she's visually impaired but not the extent of S11 and S12 athletes. After her record-breaking win, a dancing and medal-toting Pagonis posted a TikTok with the caption, \"My back hurting from carrying my gold medal.\" She has over two million followers on the social media platform. Pagonis can add to that weight on her back in these Paralympics as she's yet to compete in the 50-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle and the 200-meter individual medley. Pergolini is slated to race in the 50-meter freestyle.",

Leading the way was cyclist Sarah Storey, who is on the verge of reaching and surpassing a mark previously unmatched for Team GB Storey won the 15th gold medal of her Paralympic career in the C5 3000m individual pursuit final, beating fellow Briton Crystal Lane-Wright shortly after setting a world record in qualifying. With the 15th gold medal of her career, Storey is now only one gold medal away from tying Mike Kenny's record mark of 16 gold medals in the Paralympics, which has stood since 1988. Storey, 43, has now medaled in eight of the games she has competed in, and her 27.057 time in qualifying broke the record she had set five years ago in Rio by over four seconds. \"I've  done so much training, and everyone's been reminding me how much work  I've done and how I deserve to be that fast, but you don't like to  presume. So it took me by surprise, but a good surprise,\" Storey said in a report by BBC Sport. \"I think about one race at a time and maybe I'll think about these things afterwards. But it does feel pretty surreal.\" Storey, who was born without a functioning left hand, first competed in the Paralympics as a swimmer in 1992, and remained in that discipline before switching to cycling in 2005. Storey has since won 10 gold medals in cycling to go with her five in swimming, including in 2012 when she won the individual pursuit, 500-meter time trial, time trial, and road race in her native England. Storey's next step towards Paralympic history will come Tuesday, when she competes in the C5 road time trial.",

  "body": "This year's Olympic and Paralympic Games required athletes to train in ways that they never had before as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For British powerlifter Ali Jawad, he had to take some serious extra precautions. Jawad, 32, ended up \"indirectly\" self-isolating for three years,\u00a0the told BBC, in preparation for the Tokyo Paralympics. The athlete has Crohn's disease and was, at one point not long ago, on the brink of death. Because of his immune system being compromised, Jawad decided to self-isolate as he hoped to make the Tokyo Paralympics. \"This is probably the most invested cycle I've ever had in terms of using every ounce of physical, mental and emotional energy just to even qualify,\" Jawad said. \"The last three or four years with my Crohn's and my health, it's been the hardest of my life.\" Just hours before competing at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics, Jawad was sick with flu-like symptoms and assumed it was a run-of-the-mill stomach bug. However, the symptoms got worse when he returned to the United Kingdom after the Games. That's when he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation of the digestive tract that can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. Jawad went on to compete at the London Games in 2012, where he finished fourth, and then won silver at the following Paralympics in Rio. In preparing for the Toyko Games, Jawad has had to be extremely careful because of his Chron's disease. He even said that whether or not the COVID-19 pandemic happened, he would've been forced to isolate as a result of his condition... because he already was. He chose to isolate and make his own food, as well as not see friends and family, as a way to manage Chron's disease before the pandemic started. COVID did add to his isolation time, as the Olympics and Paralympics were postponed for a year in 2020. Jawad said that helped his situation, though. \"I was never going to make it last year and the extra year allowed me to attempt to get fitter,\" Jawad added. Jawad has stated that this will be his last Paralympics due to the intense preparation that he had to go through.",

  "body": "William Shakespeare coined the adage \"all that glitters is not gold\" back in the 16th century, and that may ring true for Chinese Olympian Zhu Xueying more than 500 years later. Xueying, who earned gold in trampoline gymnastics during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, posted photos to social media of her medal peeling off on the upper left-hand side. \"Let me clarify this\u2026 I didn't mean to peel the thing off at first, I just discovered that there was a small mark (like pic one) on my medal,\" Xueying wrote on the social-media website Sina Weibo, per the Global Times. \"I thought that it was probably just dirt, so I rubbed it with my finger and found that nothing changed, so then I picked at it and the mark got bigger.\" The Tokyo Olympic Games' Organizing Committee offered a rebuttal to the \"quality\" issue Xueying posed, telling the Global Times the material coming off the gymnast's medal was its protective coating instead of the actual gold plating. This coating is intended to protect the medals from stains and scratches and \"does not affect the quality of the medal itself,\" the Committee added. Medals awarded during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics contained metal from Japanese citizens' recycled electronic devices, an experimental practice comparable to the Jade-inlaid medals from the 2008 Beijing Games. Should Xueying need a replacement medal, she's in luck. The IOC keeps molds of all the Games' medal designs and offers replacements to Olympic winners for a fee. That foresight came in handy earlier this month when Japanese mayor Takashi Kawamura bit into the gold medal of softball pitcher Miu Goto, and -- after receiving over 8,000 complaints -- offered to pay for a replacement The 2020 Tokyo Olympics' medal maker, Japan Mint, told the Global Times it has yet to find any problems with gold-medal peeling. Still, it said the Tokyo Organizing Committee may open an investigation into the matter.",

  "body": "In the 2016 Rio Olympics, a then 19-year-old U.S. swimmer Lilly King burst onto the international stage by winning gold medals in the 4x100-meter medley and 100-meter breaststroke. She was the fourth youngest woman on a veteran-laden squad. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics, however, presented a new challenge to King: leadership. Because the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the Games a year, a new wave of U.S. swimmers entered the Olympic fray. The result: King could no longer get by as the self-described \"kid.\" \"I went from being the rookie to the vet so quickly,\" said King, who's older than 19 of her 26 Tokyo teammates. \"But in terms of my own success, it was again just a crazy meet. Obviously being pretty down after the (100-meter breaststroke) then being able to come back and do really well in the (200-meter breaststroke) was pretty cool. But yeah, it's exciting to see that I've been able to be super consistent throughout the last five years, which is something that's really hard to do.\" King bounced back from a bronze-medal finish in the 100-meter breaststroke -- an event she was favored to win -- to earn silver in the 200-meter breaststroke and 4x100-meter medley, helping the U.S. women earn a leading 18 swimming medals in Tokyo. Those two medals were far from King's only contributions. King made the \"seamless transition\" into a leader during the 2021 Games, helping first-time Olympians Lydia Jacoby (17), Claire Curzan (17), Torri Huske (18), Regan Smith (19) and Emma Weyant (19) all earn medals of their own. \"It was just kind of a crazy ride, and we all had to learn to navigate it together,\" King said. \"I think it turned out pretty well.\" King's next ride is the 2021 International Swimming League season, which will air on CBS and CBS Sports Network. You can catch the opening weekend Aug. 28 on CBS Sports Network and Aug. 29 on CBS, at noon ET each day. Her Cali Condors won the ISL Grand Final in 2020, the league's second year, and are hoping to defend their title in Naples, Italy, this fall. The Condors are led by a slew of 2020 Tokyo Olympics medalists in King, reigning ISL MVP Caeleb Dressel, Olivia Smoliga and Hali Flickinger. But despite their recent success in the Olympic pool, King emphasized that production won't directly translate to the ISL. Their team chemistry, however, will. \"It's definitely very different, different game, different scenario,\" King said. \"We got a lot of people returning from the team from last year, and we have a lot of fun together, honestly. We just win and goof off and train hard and swim fast, so it's a really great group of people, and we just build off that team chemistry and it usually works pretty well for us.\" While King is confident in the Condors' talent and camaraderie, she admits \"we were probably a little more hungry\" in their title-winning 2020 season compared to 2021. King plans to regain that hunger through her disdain for the competition. \"We just kind of hate the other teams,\" King said. \"We're really proud to be Condors, and we don't really get along that well with the other teams, to be honest. I think really that hatred of losing is what drives us.\" The ISL's regular season is slated for Aug. 26-Sept. 26 in Naples, Italy. King's Instagram-famous cat, Minnie, won't make the trip, but the 24-year-old Indiana native will be there with the positive attitude and newly-refined leadership skills responsible for her five Olympic medals and ISL championship. \"It's going to be fun,\" King said. \"That's kind of why we do this and why we swim. Just a lot of racing and a lot of fun for the athletes, and hopefully it's fun for the viewers as well.\"",

This was Richardson's first race since June's U.S. Olympic Trials, as she was suspended from the 2020 Tokyo Games for a positive marijuana test. Her highlight though, came in a post-race interview with NBC Sports, calling her return \"great\" -- and staking her claim as one of the world's top track-and-field athletes despite the disappointing finish.(Warning: NSFW language) \"I'm not upset with myself at all,\" Richardson said. \"This is one race. I'm not done. You know what I'm capable of. Count me out if you want to. Talk all the s--t you want because I'm here to stay. I'm not done. I'm the sixth-fastest woman in this game, ever, and can't nobody ever take that away from me. Congratulations to the winners. Congratulations to the people that won, but they're not done seeing me yet -- period.\" The Prefontaine Classic pitted Richardson against the three women's 100-meter medalists from Tokyo -- Jamaica's Elaine Thompson-Herah, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson -- along with fellow Americans Teahna Daniels and Javianne Oliver. Like in Tokyo, Thompson-Herah took gold, Fraser-Pryce won silver and Jackson took bronze. Daniels finished fourth while Oliver placed sixth. Richardson finished ninth with a 11.14, well below her personal-best of 10.72 -- the sixth-fastest time in the event's history -- and 10.86 from the Olympic Trials. Hours before those Olympic Trials, Richardson used marijuana to cope with the death of her mother. While USA Track and Field described the situation as \"incredibly unfortunate\" and \"devastating,\" it did not reverse Richardson's one-month suspension that would've allowed her to compete in the Tokyo Olympics. \"That sent me in a state of mind, in a state of emotional panic, if anything,\" Richardson said of her mother's passing. \"During all that, I still, even though I'm here, I still have to go out and put on a performance for my dream.\" While the 21-year-old Richardson struggled in the Prefontaine Classic, Thompson-Herah bolstered her growing legend. Thompson-Herah, who earned three gold medals (100-meter, 200-meter and 4x100-meter relay) in Tokyo,\u00a0 posted the second-fastest women's 100 meters time in history with a 10.54. Florence Griffith Joyner's world record of 10.49 has stood since 1988. To Thompson-Herah, her best is still yet to come. \"I ran 10.5 [today] and I think I have so much more in me,\" Herah told NBC Sports.",

If you include the Russian Olympic Committee results as part of Russia's Olympic history, it is the lowest finish since the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm. Russian-born athletes competed under the Russian Olympic Committee name at the 2020 Games due to penalties Russia was handed after it was discovered the country was running a doping program. Russian lawmaker Aleksei Zhuravlyov,\u00a0according to The Daily Beast, described other competing countries at the Games as \"a pack of Russophobic beasts, headed by the United States.\" On Monday, Olga Skabeeva, who is a television host on Russia's state-owned television channel, echoed those statements, saying on the air that the Summer Games were the \"clearest example of total Russophobia.\" \"These Olympic Games stink,\" Skabeeva said. \"Global sports forever ceased being an honest competition, turning into a cheap political farce. At the behest of Americans, the International Olympic Committee took away two gold medals from Russian.\" Skabeeva didn't provide any evidence to support her claims, but that didn't stop other from agreeing with the claims. \"Americans are freaks. Moral freaks. Why are we even discussing this parade of freaks and perverts?\" deputy speaker of the Russian State Duma Pyotr Tolstoy added, the Daily Beast reported. Oleg Matveychev, who is a member of the Russian Expert Institute for Social Research, referenced Russian gymnast Dina Averina's loss in the rhythmic gymnastics all-around competition as an event that was fixed. Israel's Linoy Ashram won the gold medal in the event, even after the Russian team asked for that victory to be overturned. Matveychev claimed that Ashram's gold medal should've been take away because she dropped the ribbon during her final exercise. He claimed that it would've been impossible for her to win. Ironically, Averina of Russia dropped her ribbon at the 2018 world championship, but still managed to win a gold medal.",

That's when Andrejczyk stepped in and decided to help the family. \"He already has a head start from Kubus \u2013 a boy who didn't make it in time but whose amazing parents decided to pass on the funds they collected. ... And in this way, I also want to help. It's for him that I am auctioning my Olympic silver medal,\" Andrejczyk said,\u00a0as translated by ESPN. Zabka, which is a Polish grocery store chain, won the auction with a lofty bid of $125,000, according to an announcement from Andrejczyk on Instagram. Andrejczyk added that the money will allow the eight-month old boy to receive the surgery he needs at Stanford University Medical Center. Even though Zabka won the bid for the medal, they company ended up returning the medal back to Andrejczyk. Andrejczyk's silver medal is brand new, as she won it at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The Polish javelin thrower missed out on a medal at the 2016 Olympics in Rio Janeiro by just two centimeters.",

Zakia Khudadadia, a 23-year-old taekwondo fighter, and 24-year-old track and field athlete Hossain Rasouli were both expected to compete in the 2020 Paralympics and represent Afghanistan. The pair of competitors are stuck in Afghanistan because the country's airports are closed. \"Due to the serious ongoing situation in the country, all airports are closed and there is no way for them to travel to Tokyo,\"\u00a0Hossain Rasouli, a spokesman for the International Paralympic Committee, told The Washington Post. \"We hope the team and officials remain safe and well during this difficult time.\" Khudadadi's trip to the Games would have made her Afghanistan's first-ever female Paralympian. Afghanistan Paralympic Committee's London-based Chef de Mission Arian Sadiqi noted that the two athletes were looking forward to this opportunity, especially because of the history Khudadadia was going to make. \"They were really excited prior to the situation. They were training wherever they could, in the parks and back gardens,\"\u00a0Sadiqi said, according to Reuters. \"This would have been the first female Afghan taekwondo player to take part. This was history in the making. She was very passionate to compete. Zakia would have been a great role model for the rest of the females in the country.\" A feature from the International Paralympic Committee noted the pair of athletes did not have an easy path to the Games, even before the situation with Taliban worsened in the last few weeks. The athletes had limited spaces to train leading up to the Paralympics and were forced to use spots like backyards and nearby hills. Sadiqi said he has not been able to reach either athlete recently, but believes they are both in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan.",

On Monday the New Jersey native added another line to her increasingly-stacked resume: her own footwear and apparel collection. The \"New Balance x Sydney Signature Collection\" -- which features everything from warm-up ponchos to jumpsuits and sneakers, all intended to support performance and fashion -- is \"very authentic to who I am and the message I want to get across.\" New Balance openly received McLaughlin and her message during the design and styling process. \"From the first meeting to the final approval process Syd has been so engaged in bringing this to life,\" New Balance apparel designer Rachel Walder said in a statement. \"Her drive on the track easily transitioned to the design of this collection. We know this is just the beginning for Syd and we're excited to play a part in her journey on and off the track.\" McLaughlin's journey to stardom garnered national attention during the 2016 Rio Olympics, when she became the youngest U.S. track and field Olympian ever at age 17. That would be far from the only record she'd go on to break. In June's Olympic trials, McLaughlin became the first woman to shatter the 52-second barrier in the women's 400-meter hurdles by finishing in 51.90. She then bested that world-record time by a whopping 44 tenths of a second to win the event's gold medal in Tokyo. McLaughlin also took home gold in the women's 4x400-meter relay in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, a win that gave fellow American Allyson Felix her record 11th medal. That experience was \"amazing\" and \"really special\" for McLaughlin, who idolized the five-time Olympian Felix since she was roughly eight years old. Despite being atop her sport, McLaughlin continues her strive to improve thanks to her \"be the first you\" motto -- one prominently featured in the \"New Balance x Sydney Signature Collection.\" Her symbol for the motto is a butterfly. To McLaughlin, butterflies represent \"the idea of evolving into your true version of yourself, who you're meant to be.\" The athlete McLaughlin is meant to be, in her view, has yet to arrive. \"I think it's just the idea of constantly wanting to improve,\" McLaughlin said. \"I've never had a perfect race. I think there's so much growth for me to attain. My coach and I are constantly just pushing the boundaries for myself and really striving in every single race to be better than I was before. It's been really cool, kind of just my personal progression to strive to be better and better every time I step on the track.\"",

According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Richardson is among the confirmed participants for the Prefontaine Classic at the University of Oregon. Richardson is expected to compete in the 100- and 200-meter races. \"Sha'Carri is focused on running a good race since she last competed at  the US Olympic Trials,\" Renaldo Nehemiah, Richardson's agent, told the Journal. \"She will be focused on executing her race to the  best of her ability regardless of who is in the race.\" Richardson's participation in the Classic comes following a month-long suspension by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after she tested positive for marijuana after winning the 100-meters at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June. The infraction cost Richardson a place on the U.S. Track and Field team for the Olympics. In the Prefontaine Classic, Richardson will go up against the Jamaican trio of 100-meter medalists from Tokyo: Olympic record holder and gold medalist Elaine Thompson-Herah headlines that group, which also includes Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson. Among the American Olympians in the race will be Teahna Daniels, who finished seventh in Tokyo. Based on her times from earlier this year, Richardson may very well prove a match for Thompson-Herah and the rest of the Jamaican team.

In addition to the Bills, Steveson also stated that he has a connection to the Baltimore Ravens. \"So many great organizations and teams have reached out.

But interestingly, Steveson recently shared on Pardon My Take that he has also considered playing football for his school. \"I actually talked to Coach (P.J.) Fleck of Gopher football and he wanted  me to come out before I went to the Olympic Games to come play for a  little bit,\" Steveson said. \"But I told him after the Olympic Games I will give him an  official decision.\" While Steveson going from Olympic wrestler to the NFL would be unusual, it's far from unheard of for athletes to go from Olympic glory to pro football.

Stranded and with little time to get to the track, Parchment's saving grace ended up being an Olympic volunteer named Trijana, who Parchment went back to in order to show her the gold medal he ended up winning in the event. Parchment repaid the taxi fare that Trijana had given her, and also gave her a Jamaica t-shirt for her trouble as well. In addition to Parchment himself, the Jamaican government is also set to reward Trijana. According to a report by The Gleaner, Trijana is now being invited to Jamaica by the government's Ministry of Tourism. \"It is selfless what she did; one would not know what the outcome would have been,\" said Edmund Bartlett of the Ministry of Tourism. \"No matter where in the world she is, we want to reciprocate the kindness shown to one of our own.\" Parchment ended up prevailing in the 110m hurdles in an event which saw Jamaican athletes take two of three places on the podium.

German Olympic Sports Federation president Alfons Hoermann slammed the rules barring rider-horse bonding in a press conference on Saturday. According to a translation from The Guardian, Hoermann said the international equestrian rules require an \"urgent overhaul.\" \"The numerous occasions at the competition yesterday, from literally the first to the last rider, are, we believe, unacceptable,\" Hoermann said. \"They endanger animal welfare and therefore damage the reputation of the sport and the sports men and women.\" Germany, Hoermann's home country, was directly involved in the Olympic pentathlon drama. The German coach Kim Raisner punched Saint Boy, fellow German Annika Schleu's horse, before it entered the arena. Saint Boy then refused to jump, causing Schleu, the medal contender in the Olympic event, to burst into tears and finish 31st. Raisner was banned from the Games for her actions. Earlier in the competition, Saint Boy refused to allow the Russian Olympic Committee's Gulnaz Gubaydullina to ride him. International Modern Pentathlon Union president Klaus Schormann rallied against the criticism, claiming a few \"not so nice\" moments shouldn't detract from the \"absolutely excellent\" horses and \"high quality\" facilities. To Schormann, the athletes -- not the horses -- were at fault for their struggles in the pentathlon. \"We tested them and they were well prepared, and there is no basis for athletes to complain,\"\u00a0Schormann told the Irish Examiner. \"It is only because of the athletes themselves if they were not successful in some parts of the competition.\" The modern pentathlon's governing body, the UIPM, said it would undertake a \"full review of the Riding discipline of the Women's Modern Pentathlon at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games\" in a statement.",

Entering the stadium with 10,000 people rumbling your name? The ecstasy of experiencing competition with another at a level so deep and so unrecognizable that it plays out not in a pool but in one's soul? What is the cost of these dreams, though? For most, it is in the past. The hours that were inputted, the opportunities that were forgone, the relationships that were paused. The two-week stretch in Tokyo with the curtain drawn to the world is the end of that cost. It is the payoff, or a portion of it. That's the joy you see on so many faces. The delight that perhaps the sacrifice was worthy. For some, though, what has been paid in the past pales in comparison to what will come due for the rest of their lives. When you are historically great, you never escape people wanting you to do the thing that made them feel the way they felt that one time you did it so memorably. Even if they don't say it to you, that is the eternal subtext. Swim like you did in Beijing, Michael. Play like you did at Augusta, Tiger. Dunk like you did when you were 23, Vince. I read a haunting quote last week from one of the preeminent athletes at these Summer Games. It was uttered in the wake of a week-long competition that thrives on drama, rivalry and numbers measured by the hundredth. Here is the quote: \"The sport was a lot more fun when no one knew my name, to be honest.\" Who do you think said that? You might think it was Novak Djokovic, Naomi Osaka or Simone Biles, all of whom exited earlier than expected at these Games. All very famous athletes -- all struggling with the mental and physical consequences of being very famous athletes. This is a conversation almost exclusive to those who have The Gift. The ones with talents nearly beyond their own ability to tend to them. This is not to say that the most gifted do not work hard because, in fact, if they did not work as hard or harder than anyone then we would never know they had The Gift to begin with. So few receive The Gift, even fewer do something with it. The Gift begets success and success begets fame. Fame begets everything else, including, insidiously so at these Olympic Games, the weight of expectations. The cost of these dreams for those with The Gift is the expectation not that the experience would be wonderful for you but that you would make it wonderful for me. Never has it been easier to hear that drumbeat that, I suspect, has always existed. Never has it been harder to tune it out. The burden of that is more than anyone was ever meant to bear. Caeleb Dressel, arguably the most decorated athlete at these Olympics, uttered the quote above. Its biggest star. The one whose fame and renown changed the most from two weeks ago. The most successful by the standards of most people in the world. The implication here should be obvious: sport and competition are fun, manifesting Atlas is not. In my country, there are two currencies. I don't know the cultural nuances of other countries, but in the United States you either deal in fame or you deal in money. Both can be spent to consolidate power. Those are, presumably, what everyone is after as a gateway to happiness and peace, and the ones with The Gift usually receive oodles of both. Yet how rarely do those who achieve what we all say we want to achieve find happiness and peace? I cover golf, so I always think of Tiger Woods when I think of The Gift. I think of the story -- perhaps apocryphal, but nonetheless the absolute perfect description of his life -- about his answer to why he enjoyed going out on his boat, named Privacy (!), so much. He apparently said because when you stare at all the fish, none of them stare back at you. The Gift, it turns out, comes with a curse. Fame is ostensibly one of the benefits of success, but the cold reality seems to be that the weight of it is actually its greatest cost. There's a famous Jim Carrey quote about fame. Many of you have probably heard it, but it doesn't get talked about enough. It doesn't get posted as a warning sign to our wide-eyed 17-year-olds enough: \"I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it's not the answer.\" Damn. The No. 1 story from the Tokyo Olympics was those who did not participate. I am extremely disinterested in the micro-tentacles of Simone Biles' decision to withdraw from the gymnastics competition altogether. There is a time and a place to dissect such decisions, and a world in which only those who enter the arena have authority to critique is both ridiculous and undesirable for all. There are, however, so many nuances to her specific situation and, broadly speaking, she deserves all the benefit of the doubt in the world given both her history and the circumstances. What I am interested in is the creation of a culture in which this could be (and will be) commonplace. That's the conversation here. If you think Biles should have persevered because -- what is the ubiquitous narrative here? -- that's what American athletes do, by golly (!), then maybe this is a conversation for you. I think about Biles going to Rio in 2016, a teenager with immense hopes. Much has happened since then, and all of it can be summed up in what Padraig Harrington, of all people, said at the 2021 PGA Championship. In golf circles, we have gone back to this quote so many times over the last few months: \"People often ask, in a general term, about experience. Well, as you gain experience, you lose innocence. I suppose if you drew a graph, there's a crossing point of equilibrium where you have some experience and a certain amount of innocence and enthusiasm. As you get a little bit older and you get all this experience, on paper people might think you get better with experience. But as I said, you've seen a few things that you know in your game that you probably never wanted to see, so you kind of lose that little bit of, I suppose, innocence. It's not everything it's cracked up to be to have experience.\" Biles, more or less, said the same thing last week about the time before the time when everyone knew her name. She was talking about the details of her sport (and so was Harrington), but it doesn't take a huge leap to apply the same principle to what happens outside of it. \"I'm a little bit more scared of my skills now,\" Biles said. \"Because whenever I was younger, I was pretty fearless. But now I'm just like, 'Okay, I'm getting older. This could go wrong, this could go wrong, that could do this.' And so, that kind of scares me a little bit.\" Innocence should be protected at all costs within an athlete's world. If you are a manager or an agent or a coach, it is the most valuable asset you can manage because it is the most fleeting. \"The sport was a lot more fun when no one knew my name.\" There are many angles to this problem. The internet has exacerbated everything. Our identities become wrapped up in who other people say that we are. We have bequeathed the base, human question, \"Will I be loved?\" to folks who have no authority on the matter. We want all information at all times in all places on all devices without considering either the monetary or cultural costs. We are reaping what others have sown. Some of this is on those with The Gift. You don't have to be on Instagram or do the P&G ads or the \"Today With Hoda & Jenna\" interviews. But stiff-arming the spotlight can feel like trying to stop an avalanche with a snow shovel. Given the tiny window you have to cash in, I'm sure it can feel unwise. Never has it been more demanding to be a world-class athlete. You have to do the thing that you do better than anyone else, but then you are also expected to do 25 other things that you were not trained to do -- and do them well every single day with almost no reprieve. I think a lot about a quote from Rory McIlroy's uncle in this great Golf Digest cover story by Jaime Diaz. Rory is another of those with The Gift, and he has warred with himself about how to handle it for a long time. \"Time has become his most precious commodity,\" said Brian McIlroy. \"He is absolutely delighted on those days when there is nothing he has to do.\" The sport was a lot more fun when no one knew my name. I don't know what we do here. I think we're in too deep. I am part of the problem. We all have a part in it. I desire a healthier path forward for us as a society and for those who are toddlers but have already been predisposed with The Gift. I don't want future Michael Phelps' to contemplate suicide because the gravity around them is heavier than it should be. There's a great proverb from the Bible (Proverbs 30:8) that could apply to all of this and to our path forward: \"Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me \u2026\" Give me neither poverty nor riches. Who among us is brave enough, is humble enough to ask for such a thing? In so many instances, I am not. For most athletes that competed at the Tokyo Games, the cost of these dreams ended on Sunday. That's it. For some \u2013 a handful or so with The Gift \u2013 they will steal away and try to wriggle out of it. Maybe they will retire and come back later in a different role, like Phelps has done. Maybe they feel stuck. Maybe they will re-enter the grind. For as much joy and wonder and gold as the Olympics brings, it also brings a sliver of sadness. Because though most have paid the price and received their reward in Tokyo, for some the cost of these dreams can feel like it has no end.",

  "body": "Happy Monday everyone, Shanna McCarriston back with tons of news from the sports world. Hope you had a wonderful weekend and enjoyed the final events of the Olympics. Last night was the Pro Football Hall of Fame ceremony and I loved watching highlights of the players in the 2021 class and listening to stories from their careers. I grew up watching Peyton Manning play (many times losing to Tom Brady \ud83d\ude04) so it felt wild to see him secure his place in football history. We will talk about the ceremony more in today's newsletter, but before we get to that, we have some other stuff to discuss, such as the top Olympic moments, Lionel Messi and more. Let's get to it. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics have come and gone, and they brought us some incredible moments from the top athletes around the world. The United States took home the most medals of any country with 113. Team USA combined for 39 gold, 41 silver and 33 bronze. China took home the second-most with 88, while host country Japan finished the Games with 58. There were many incredible Team USA moments to choose from as the best, and here are just a few: One of my favorite moments was easily the women's basketball team winning their seventh gold medal. Dominance in any sport is difficult enough, but it's especially hard when you are going against the best in the world. Simply put, Team USA always finds a way to win. Bird and Taurasi making history by becoming the first basketball players, man or woman, to win five Olympic gold medals is the icing on the cake. For full commentary on all the top moments, click here. Lionel Messi\u00a0has said his goodbyes to Barcelona and is now likely headed to Paris Saint-Germain. Messi's time with Barcelona, the only club he's played for, ended with an emotional press conference this past weekend. He discussed what the city and team meant to him, and did so through many tears. The superstar is now reportedly headed to play with PSG, according to CBS Sports' Fabrizio Romano -- who in great detail explained how Messi's split with Barcelona happened. Here is a look at the proposed details of his new contract: Some details still remain to be seen, as an official agreement has not been made yet. Last year, Messi revealed he wanted to leave Barcelona, which was the beginning of the end of his time with the club. His contractual situation was never settled due to La Liga salary cap issues, which led to this, but clearly he was not totally emotionally ready to leave Barcelona. Tom Brady is not thrilled with his fellow players. He said so much over the weekend,\u00a0calling them \"ignorant\" on social media. The defending champion seemed to be upset that the NFL's salary cap went down, even though the value of every team in the league increased by an average of 14% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the current salary cap is set at $182.5 million -- a 20% decrease. The team with the biggest increase in value? None other than Brady's Buccaneers, whose value went up by 29%. Here's what Brady's problem with all of this is, in his own words: Strong words from Brady, who would likely want to see the NFLPA negotiate a better collective bargaining agreement in the future. Ultimately, the seven-time champion isn't thrilled that the owners seem to be getting a better deal from the players, but as CBS Sports' John Breech pointed out, it's not that clear cut. Salary cap goes hand-in-hand with total revenue, which went down $4 billion during the coronavirus pandemic. Owners could counter argue that they took those losses while players got what they were promised. Regardless, the cap likely will increase from now on, with a 2022 cap going as high as $208.2, a 14% increase over 2021, the league announced. College Football Hall of Fame coach Bobby Bowden died at 91 on Sunday. Just weeks ago, the Florida State legend announced that he was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Bowden's son, Terry Bowden, later confirmed that his father had pancreatic cancer. Bowden's time with Florida State football -- all 34 years --elevated the program beyond measure in Tallahassee. Here's a snapshot of his 40-year career as a major college coach: Following his death this weekend,\u00a0friends, family, players and fans expressed their condolences for the coach on social media. \u26be Reds vs. Indians, 6:10 p.m.\u00a0|\u00a0CLE +150 | TV: MLB.TV \u26be White Sox vs. Twins, 8:10 p.m.\u00a0|\u00a0MIN +170 | TV: ESPN \u26be Yankees vs. Royals, 8:10 p.m. | KC +157 | TV: MLB.TV As someone who started watching football in 2001 at the young age of six, Peyton Manning was a face I watched for my entire childhood. Sometimes I watched him with hatred (those six times he beat Brady and the Patriots), sometimes I thanked him for his interceptions in Foxboro or on the road (the 11 times he was defeated by Bill Belichick's crew) and sometimes I watched him and laughed when he was in commercials or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" No matter what, though, I always watched him with respect, even as a rival to my hometown team. Watching his Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinement, with his rival-turned-friend Brady in his personal section, felt like a culmination of the time I started to love football. He joked that Brady won't retire until 2035, referencing how the 44-year-old just doesn't ever seem to be nearing his career. It was great to watch two GOATs interact and laugh on a stage like the HoF's.",

  "body": "The 2020 Tokyo Olympics are a wrap, and these Games were definitely ones to remember. Established stars such as Katie Ledecky and Kevin Durant delivered on their sky-high expectations while new ones emerged in first-time Team USA Olympians Sydney McLaughlin, Suni Lee and more. Allyson Felix became the most decorated track and field Olympian in U.S. history by winning her 11th career medal while swimmer Caeleb Dressel collected an impressive five golds in Tokyo. The U.S. also swept the men's and women's golf and basketball competitions. Overall, the U.S. claimed an Olympics-leading 113 medals (39 gold, 41 silver, 33 bronze). COUNTRY GOLD SILVER BRONZE TOTALS United States 39 41 33 113 China 38 32 18 88 Japan 27 14 17 58 Great Britain 22 21 22 65 Russian Olympic Committee 20 28 23 71 Here are our top 10 memories from Tokyo. In the women's 200m final, Katie Ledecky shockingly placed fifth -- her worst ever Olympic finish -- and more than a half second out of medal position. The now 10-time Olympic medalist (seven gold, three silver) emphatically rebounded just over an hour later. Ledecky (15:37.34) dominated the Olympics' first ever women's 1500m final, finishing more than four seconds faster than her fellow American and silver medalist Erica Sullivan (15:41.41). Germany's Sarah Kohler earned bronze with a time of 15:42.91. The 24-year-old Ledecky finished her 2020 Tokyo Olympics campaign with four medals. \"I've gained perspective over the years,\" Ledecky said. \"I've really learned a lot over the years. The times (in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics) might not be my best times, but I'm still really, really happy that I have a gold medal around my neck right now.\" After the \"twisties\" forced Simone Biles to withdraw from four gymnastics finals, a return from the two-time Olympian looked unlikely. But in typical Biles fashion, she rose to glory when it mattered most. Biles delivered a 14.000 in the women's balance beam final to earn her second consecutive Olympic bronze in the event. China's Guan Chenchen and Tang Xijing finished 1-2 with scores of 14.633 and 14.233, respectively. Biles, who also won silver in this year's team competition, is now a seven-time Olympic medalist (four gold, one silver, two bronze). \"I'm proud of myself for the way I pushed through and even learned that dismount that I haven't done in years,\" Biles told the \"TODAY\" show. \"And just put up a good set, that's all I really wanted. I wasn't expecting to walk away with a medal or anything, I just wanted to go out there and do it for myself. And I did.\" As expected, an American won the women's 100m breaststroke. The unexpected: it wasn't the reigning Olympic gold medalist Lilly King. Lydia Jacoby, a 17-year-old Alaskan, stunned the pool and viewing audience by finishing ahead of both King (1:05.54) and South Africa's Tatjana Schoenmaker (1:05.22) to win gold. The win by Jacoby gave Alaska its first ever Olympic swimming medal. When Jacoby also took home silver in the 4x100m medley relay, she joined alpine skier Tommy Moe as the only Alaskans to win more than one medal in a single Olympics. \"It was crazy,\" Jacoby said. \"I was definitely racing for a medal. I knew I had it in me, but I wasn't really expecting a gold medal. When I looked up at the scoreboard, it was insane.\" In the lead-up to these Olympics, 24-year-old Caeleb Dressel was considered a potential successor to the GOAT -- otherwise known as Michael Phelps. Dressel lived up to the hype in his very first race of the 2021 Games. In the men's 4x100m freestyle, Dressel led the U.S. to gold by swimming a blazing-fast time of 47.26 as the first leg. The Americans finished with third-fastest time ever in the event, a 3:08.97, while Italy (3:10.11) and Australia (3:10.22) finished second and third, respectively. Dressel eventually won four additional golds in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. \"I felt good the whole way, I knew I had to get my hand in the wall first and get some clean water,\" Dressel said. \"And everyone did their job. It's a relay for a reason, it's four guys for a reason, it's certainly not just me. It's certainly not just one guy.\" When the reigning gold medalist Biles withdrew from the women's all-around competition, she opened the door for a new champion. Fellow American and first-time Olympian Suni Lee took full advantage. The 18-year-old Lee collected her first gold medal with a score of 57.433, above the silver medalist Rebeca Andrade (57.298) of Brazil and Angeline Melnikova (57.199) of the Russian Olympic Committee. Lee, who came into these Games as the first ever Hmong-American Olympic gymnast, made additional history by becoming the ethnic group's first medalist. \"I really want to be an inspiration to others and help others reach their dreams,\" Lee told the \"TODAY\" show. An opening group play loss to France marred the Americans' start to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but Team USA left the Games with exactly what it wanted: its fourth consecutive gold medal. Kevin Durant contributed a team-leading 29 points along with six rebounds and three assists in a rematch with France in the men's basketball final, an 87-82 victory for the Americans, earning his third gold. Only Carmelo Anthony -- who Durant passed on Team USA's all-time scoring list in these Games -- has as many golds as Durant now among all-time men's basketball Olympians. Jayson Tatum added 19 points -- on an efficient 8-of-14 shooting -- and a team-high seven rebounds in the final. \"I know it seems as if it's come easy for so long, but I played in 2016 and it wasn't easy then and it wasn't easy this year,\" Team USA's Draymond Green said. \"Don't get me wrong, I don't take either one of them for granted, but this one just feels a lot sweeter.\" The women's 400m hurdle featured eight athletes, but most eyes were only on two: Americans Sydney McLaughlin and reigning gold medalist Dalilah Muhammad. Muhammad and McLaughlin came into the event in a tier of their own, with the two women setting the last two world records in the event. The pair continued their record-breaking trend in Tokyo, adding the second and third ever sub-52 second finishes by a woman in the event's history. McLaughlin earned gold with a time of 51.46 while Muhammad earned silver with a 51.58. At 21, McLaughlin became the youngest women's 400m hurdles Olympic gold medalist ever. \"I saw Dalilah ahead of me with one to go,\" McLaughlin said. \"I just thought 'Run your race'. \"The race doesn't really start till hurdle seven and I just wanted to go out there and give it everything I had.\" Less than a week after Xander Schauffele gave the U.S. its first men's gold medal in golf since 1900, Nelly Korda did the same on the women's side. Korda posted a 17-under 267 to secure a one-shot victory over Japan's Mone Inami and Australia's Lydia Ko, who each posted 16-under 268s. Inami bested Ko in a playoff to earn silver. Korda, the world's top-ranked golfer, battled rainy conditions in Tokyo for her eventual victory. In addition to her Olympic success, Korda has three LPGA wins to her name this year. \"It's tough to win out here and she makes it look easy,\" said Jessica Korda, Nelly's sister and fellow competitor in the Tokyo Games. \"But these girls are good. Look at the leaderboard every week. This is how it is. So for her to be doing what she's doing is insane to me. But at the same time, it's so cool. This is like total G.O.A.T. status for me.\" Allyson Felix came into the women's 4x400m relay final with a chance at passing fellow American Carl Lewis for the most track and field medals ever by an American athlete, and she accomplished exactly that. Team USA -- led by Sydney McLaughlin, Felix, Dalilah Muhammad and Athing Mu -- won gold with a season-best time of 3:16.85. Poland (3:20.53) and Jamaica (3:21.24) finished with silver and bronze, respectively. The win gave Felix her record 11th medal, a storybook ending to the career of one of the most prolific Olympians ever. \"It's an amazing group of women right here,\" McLaughlin said. \"Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I think we all just knew going in it was going to be fast. All we had to do is do our part and just have fun with it.\" Brittney Griner missed only four of her 18 shots in a dominant 30-point, three-block performance against Japan, helping Team USA collect a 90-75 win in the women's basketball gold medal game. Her 30 points set a women's gold-medal game record. This was Team USA's seventh consecutive gold medal with Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi being a part of the last five, making them the most decorated basketball players in Olympic history. This is likely the final Olympics for Bird -- who confirmed she won't be back for Paris 2024 -- and Taurasi -- who indicated she will not return -- and they couldn't have asked for a better finish. \"There's always a lot of pressure when you put this jersey on,\" Taurasi said. \"I think you learn a lot about yourself when you play with the national team. It's always a collection of 12 of the best players in the world and you have to set yourself aside and come together to win, and it's not easy and it comes in different forms but we always find a way to do that and do it with class and team first. It's pretty amazing. It teaches you a lot about yourself and other people.\"",

Overall, 339 medals were handed out across 33 sports and Team USA was the big winner collecting one third of all of the medals that were awarded.

  "date": "8/8/2021",

  "body": "One of the most preposterous streaks in sports remained active Saturday morning in Tokyo: Katie Ledecky is undefeated in every 800-meter freestyle race she's competed in for 11 years. The most dominant female swimmer in history cemented her status and immortalized her legend in her final race of 2021 with her signature discipline. Ledecky touched the wall in 8:12.57, giving her the sixth individual gold and 10th Olympic medal of her career. Her six individual gold medals are now the most by any female U.S. Olympian ever and second-most in swimming to one person: Michael Phelps may forever hold an untouchable number with 13. But for as phenomenal as Phelps' five-Olympiad career was, it's Ledecky who commands a dominance in certain parts of swimming we've simply never seen before. Her supremacy specifically in the 800-meter freestyle might represent the most inevitable any athlete has been at anything ... ever? Sounds like hyperbole? It's not. It's not that she always wins, it's that she has defined the parameters of what success is in the women's 800-meter freestyle. Ledecky owns\u00a0the 22 best times in the history of the event. This is obscene authority. Her latest gold also meant achieving a three-peat in the 800 free. It marks just the fourth time in history a swimmer has won gold in an individual discipline in three consecutive Olympics. (Phelps' four straight in the 200-meter individual medley has never been matched.) Saturday's 8:12.57 pace was ho-hum by Ledecky standards; it was merely the 16th-fastest time she's logged. Ledecky, 24, beat out rival Ariarne Titmus, 20, who was not the same swimmer in the 800 as she was when Titmus beat Ledecky earlier in the week in the 200- and 400-meter freestyles. The Aussie hung close the entire race but never truly threatened Ledecky. Titmus touched in 8:13.83. Consider this: Titmus' silver-winning swim on Saturday was the fastest non-Ledecky time in the history of the women's 800-meter freestyle. It barely bested the 23rd-best time of Ledecky's career. Laughable! And now these two will almost certainly get to meet again in three years, when the Games will head to Paris. With that, it's likely\u00a0there will be no bigger storyline for the 2024 Summer Olympics than Ledecky vs. Titmus. That's right: Ledecky's Olympic career isn't over. While there wasn't too much speculation over this, it's nonetheless news that Ledecky went on record for the first time at these Games to state she is not retiring. \"That was not my last swim -- I'm at least going to '24,\" Ledecky said on NBC. \"Maybe '28, we'll see. But I knew [the 800] was going to be my last swim here. You never take anything for granted, you don't know if you're going to be back at the next Olympics, so just try to soak it all in.\" Ledecky and Titmus wound up splitting their four head-to-head meets in Tokyo, with Titmus taking gold in the 200 and 400 free, while Ledecky won in the 800 free and easily cruised in the first-ever Olympic 1,500-meter freestyle for women. (Titmus did not swim in that event.) In the 4x200 free relay, Ledecky swam the fastest leg (1:53.76) of any swimmer to lift the U.S. to a silver -- and edge Titmus and the Australians (bronze) in the process. \"It's awesome,\" Ledecky said on NBC. \"I just wanted to finish on a really good note, and I'm just so happy.\" With Ledecky's Tokyo action now complete, a recap of what she went through in a six-day stretch. These are only the finals; we're not even accounting for the prelims and semifinal heats she had to swim in as well. No swimmer logged more laps in the pool in Tokyo than Ledecky. Four medals in a six-day span. Ledecky was the only swimmer to compete in a \"sprint\" race (the 200 free) and the 1,500. Think of it this way: You don't see track athletes compete in the 100- or 200-meter dash and also run the 1,500, or 5,000, or 10,000 meters. She's different from any Olympian we've ever watched. It's been Ledecky's successes, in addition to her not taking gold in two of the five events she competed in, that's helped remind us that Olympic greatness can be about transcendent dominance -- but also shortcomings that humanize these athletes. An important facet of the Olympics is that they allow for non-binary results (not just one winner and all losers, but three medals to hand out) and make sports fans -- American sports fans in particular -- reconsider what elite achievement is. Katie Ledecky is not undefeated in the pool; no one ever is. But she's special and unlike anyone we've seen before. She's beatable, but she's unique. And with this showing in Tokyo -- two more golds, two more silvers -- Ledecky has unequivocally elevated herself to her own tier of Olympic greatness. She didn't need to sweep and take five golds to get there. A lesson to be applied. The best part is it's not over. Ledecky wasn't the force of nature in Tokyo that she was in Rio in 2016, which was clearly her peak. But in the presence of a true foil in Titmus, and with a race regimen that was viciously grueling, Ledecky proved she has no analog.",

After going undefeated in the group stage, Team USA took care of Australia in the quarterfinal round and blew out Serbia by 20 points in the semifinals. Now, they'll face Japan in the gold medal game (Saturday, 10:30 p.m. ET on NBC) to try and capture its seventh-straight gold medal. France and Serbia will face off for the bronze medal. There was a slight concern entering the tournament, as the Americans dropped a rare exhibition game prior to the start of the Olympics against an Australian team without its best player, Liz Cambage.

  "body": "The final women's basketball contest at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo arrives late on Saturday evening. The United States faces Japan in the gold medal game in a rematch from group play. Team USA triumphed by a margin of 86-69 in the first matchup. Japan has not lost another game in the tournament and is playing at a high level as the challenger. Tip-off is scheduled for 10:30 p.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Team USA women's basketball as the 18-point favorite in the latest USA vs. Japan odds. The over-under for total points expected is listed at 161. Before finalizing any Japan vs. USA gold medal women's basketball picks or predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics nearing a conclusion, Tierney has analyzed Saturday's USA vs. Japan gold medal matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 basketball odds and betting trends for Japan vs. USA: USA is the most talented team in the field and it shows in the results. After a nine-point win in the opener, the Americans have won every game by double figures, including back-to-back wins by at least 20 points during the knockout stage. Team USA has size, athleticism and physicality that no opponent can match, and the Americans proved earlier in the tournament that they can handle Japan's playing style on the way to a 17-point win. Team USA has won an amazing 54 straight games in Olympic play, and is aiming for its seventh straight gold medal. On top of that, Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi are looking to become the first basketball players to win five gold medals, and the United States hasn't lost a game at the Olympics since 1992 in Barcelona. Japan is dangerous due to its shooting and passing prowess, but the Americans are heavy favorites for a reason. Japan is a strong offensive team that is dangerous against any opponent. It is tied for the tournament scoring lead at 83.6 points per game, and Japan is leading the entire field in 3-pointers (13.0 per game), 3-point attempts (31.8 per game) and 3-point percentage (40.9 percent). Some of that effectiveness stems from raw shooting talent, but Japan is also an elite passing team. The Japanese average 23.6 assists per game as a team, taking advantage of fantastic ball movement and player movement, and Japan also has the fewest turnovers (10.6 per game) in the field. Rui Machida is the embodiment of Japan's offensive attack, and she is lapping the entire field in averaging 13.8 assists per game during the Olympics. Machida generates 5.3 assists for every turnover she commits and, when compared to the United States, Japan's ball security could be huge. Team USA is averaging the second-most turnovers (17.8 per game) in the entire field, and that could swing things in Japan's direction. Tierney is leaning under on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the Team USA vs. Japan spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball predictions at SportsLine. So who wins the USA vs. Japan in the gold medal game for women's basketball? And which side of the Japan vs. USA spread is a must-back? Visit SportsLine now to get Mike Tierney's predictions for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, all from the renowned sportswriter who's covered nine Olympics in person and cashed big in both 2016 and '18, and find out.",

  "body": "The United States men's basketball team has won the gold medal after defeating France, 87-82, avenging the loss Team USA suffered in the opening game of group play. It is the fourth straight Olympic gold for the Americans. As he has been for the majority of the tournament, Kevin Durant was spectacular for Team USA as he finished the win with 29 points to go along with six rebounds and three assists. Jayson Tatum stepped up to provide Durant with the most help on the offensive end, finishing with 19 points to join Damian Lillard and Jrue Holiday as double-digit scorers as the guards finished the game with 11 points apiece. Team USA is coached by San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who is the successor to Mike Krzyzewski. Popovich previously won a bronze medal as an assistant coach under Larry Brown at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Joining Popovich on the coaching staff are\u00a0Golden State Warriors\u00a0coach Steve Kerr, Indiana Pacers assistant coach Lloyd Pierce and Villanova University coach Jay Wright. The Olympics opened on July 23 in Tokyo. The group stage of the Olympic basketball tournament took place from July 25 to Aug. 1, and the knockout stage will run from Aug. 3-7. With that said, here's a look at the grouping, standings, schedule and results for men's basketball at the Olympics.

The U.S. team of Springsteen, Laura Kraut and McLain Ward took home silver in the jumping team final. After the event, Springsteen immediately called her parents to celebrate. The conversation, while joyous, wasn't exactly enlightening. \"I FaceTimed them really quick,\" said Springsteen, who's ranked 14th in the world. \"They were all screaming, I don't think we understood anything.\" The U.S. had a shot at gold in a jump-off with Sweden, the exact situation it faced en route to its 2018 world championship. This time, however, the Swedes came out on top with a time of 122.90 and no penalties as opposed to the Americans' 124.20 and no penalties. Springsteen isn't the only American equestrian with a fascinating background. Her teammate Laura Kraut, who won gold in the team jumping event in the 2008 Beijing Games, became the U.S.'s oldest Olympic medalist at age 55. Even though Springsteen's dad once performed for 300,000 people, she wasn't free of nerves during Saturday's final. She persevered through the nerves and earned her country a medal anyway. \"You definitely start to get the jitters,\" Springsteen said. \"But it was also super exciting. My horse jumped it beautifully. And we really gave it our all out there.\"",

  "body": "The 2020 Tokyo Olympics may be coming to a close on Sunday, but the competition looks to remain as exciting as ever in the interim. Finals in women's basketball, women's volleyball and the men's marathon are set for Saturday, the Games' penultimate day, with the U.S. vying for gold in all. Here's what to watch on Saturday, Day 16 of the Games, and a quick recap of all the Olympic action that transpired on Friday. Stay up to date with how countries are performing at the Games by checking out our medal counter. Team USA collected its fourth consecutive gold medal in a 87-82 victory over a France team led by Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier. Kevin Durant scored a team-leading 29 points for the U.S. while adding six rebounds and three assists. The 32-year-old forward now joins Carmelo Anthony -- who he just passed on Team USA's all-time scoring list -- as the only three-time men's basketball gold medalists in Olympic history. Fellow American Jayson Tatum contributed 19 points and seven rebounds. American Molly Seidel claimed bronze in the women's marathon, giving the U.S. its first women's marathon medal since Deena Kastor's bronze in 2004 and third all-time. Kenya's Peres Jepchirchir and Brigid Kosgei finished 1-2 and just above Seidel (2:27:46) with season-best times of 2:27:20 and 2:27:36, respectively. This was just the third ever marathon for Seidel, a four-time cross-country champion at Notre Dame, and she made the most of it. Nelly Korda, the world's top-ranked golfer, shot a 17-under 267 to win Team USA's first women's golf gold medal since 1900. She fended off strong competition from Japan's Mone Inami and Australia's Lydia Ko, who tied at 268, to win by a single stroke. Inami and Ko finished with silver and bronze, respectively, after they competed in a playoff for second. This is the Americans' second gold medal in golf in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, as Xander Schauffele won gold on the men's side last Sunday. The U.S. took home silver in the jumping team final, falling just shy of Sweden in a jump-off for gold. Belgium won bronze. American equestrian Laura Kraut, 55, became her country's oldest Olympic medalist since 1904. A two-time Olympian, Kraut also won gold in the team jumping event in the 2008 Beijing Games. McLain Ward and Jessica Springsteen, the daughter of singers Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa, won silver alongside Kraut in the event. This U.S.-Sweden matchup is a rematch of a prior classic, as the Americans bested the Swedes in a jump-off at the 2018 world championship. Team USA trotted out its biggest stars for the women's 4x400 relay final in Sydney McLaughlin, Allyson Felix, Dalilah Muhammad and Athing Mu. They were as dominant as advertised. The American foursome sped to a gold medal-winning time of 3:16.85, the event's fifth-fastest time ever. Poland finished second with a national-record time of 3:30.53 while Jamaica took bronze with a season-best 3:21.24. The silver gave the 35-year-old Felix -- who's competing in her fifth and final Games -- her 11th Olympic medal, the most by any U.S. track and field athlete in history. Her 10 coming into the race was tied with fellow American Carl Lewis. Men's track and field was largely a struggle for the U.S. in the 2021 Games, but its finish was anything but. Michael Cherry, Michael Norman, Bryce Deadmon and Rae Benjamin dominated the men's 4x400 relay, finishing with a season-best time of 2:55.70 -- well ahead of silver-medalist Netherlands (2:57.18) and bronze-medalist Botswana (2:57.18). This was the second of two U.S. men's track and field golds in Tokyo, the fewest it's ever had in a single Olympics. Ryan Crouser, the world-record shot-putter, was the other American gold-medal winner. Team USA won its first ever Olympic silver medal in a 2-0 loss to Japan in the men's baseball final. Japan, which won its first medal since 2004 and first ever gold, became the first host country to win an Olympic men's baseball final. American infielder Eddy Alvarez, who served as an opening ceremony flag bearer, became the third American in history to earn medals in both the summer and winter Olympics. In the 2014 Sochi Games, Alvarez won silver in the men's 5000m relay speed-skating event.",

  "body": "No. 1-ranked Nelly Korda delivered Team USA its second golf gold medal of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on Saturday. Korda's gold medal victory comes nearly one week after the fifth-ranked men's golfer in the world, Xander Schauffele, captured the top prize in the the men's competition. Korda, who also claimed the Women's PGA Championship back in June, posted a 17-under 267 across four rounds to claim a one-shot victory over Japan's Mone Inami and Australia's Lydia Ko. Inami and Ko posted matching 16-under 268s to finish with silver and bronze, respectively, as the pair competed in a playoff for the silver medal. \"It's crazy,\" Korda said after the win.\"It sounds absurd that I'm a gold medal [winner]. and I'm an Olympian. I don't know it just hasn't sunk in yet.\" Ko is the only back-to-back Olympic women's golf medalist since the sport returned to the Games in 2016 after a 112-year absence. She earned silver in the 2016 Rio Games, which she entered as the world's top-ranked player, and knows exactly how impressive it is to succeed with those expectations like Korda has. \"It's not easy playing as the No. 1 in the Olympics. I did that in Rio,\" Ko said. \"And for her to fight through those kind of pressure and expectations and to end up winning the gold, I think it shows what kind of class player she is. I'm sure this is the start of many more majors and many more wins for Nelly.\" Korda held a significant lead heading into the final round, but her 69 in that frame trailed the 65s of both Inami and Ko. Still, it was enough to secure a golf sweep of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics for the Americans. Prior to these Games, the American men's and women's golf teams had gone 121 years each without a golf gold medal. They both broke that barrier in Tokyo.",

  "body": "Luka Doncic leads Slovenia in the bronze medal game against Patty Mills and Australia on Saturday morning. The teams battle at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, with the winner joining the United States and France on the medal stand. Slovenia fell to France in a narrow contest in the semifinals. Australia fell short against the heavily-favored American side. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 a.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Slovenia as the 2.5-point favorite in the latest Slovenia vs. Australia odds, while the over-under for total points expected is 181.5. Before finalizing any Australia vs. Slovenia picks or bronze medal basketball predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics nearing a conclusion, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Saturday's Slovenia vs. Australia bronze medal matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 basketball odds and betting trends for Australia vs. Slovenia: Slovenia has been an offensive juggernaut throughout the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, and that is its calling card. Doncic is an elite initiator, averaging 24.2 points, 10.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists per game, and the team leads the tournament in averaging 102.4 points per game. Slovenia is a tremendously efficient shooting team, making 49 percent of its shots overall, and it has the best 2-point shooting mark (61 percent) in the field. Slovenia's overall shot profile is analytically sound, with a tournament-leading 21.8 free-throw attempts per game and more 3-point attempts than any other squad. Finally, Slovenia's offense is well-rounded. Slovenia is grabbing 14.0 offensive rebounds per game, leading the Olympics, and is committing only 11.4 turnovers per contest. Australia is fully capable of scoring in bunches, but Slovenia's offensive track record is highly impressive and Doncic projects as the best player on the floor in the bronze medal matchup. Australia is a beautifully effective offensive team. The Australians are averaging more than 86 points per game in Tokyo, and a lot of that can be attributed to ball movement and perimeter shooting. Australia is No. 2 in the tournament in 3-point accuracy at more than 40 percent, and the Australians attempt more than 30 shots per game from long distance. Australia is also No. 2 in assists (24.8 per game), and it is generating nearly two assists for every turnover committed during the Olympics. Mills is the centerpiece of Australia's offensive approach, and the veteran guard is producing 19.6 points and 5.8 assists per game while connecting on 44 percent of his 3-point attempts. Joe Ingles, a standout of the Utah Jazz, adds supporting talent, and the Australians also boast other NBA talents in Matisse Thybulle, Dante Exum, Matthew Dellavedova and recently signed big man Jock Landale. Thybulle is a force defensively, averaging 3.0 steals per game in Tokyo, and Australia can create havoc for the high-powered Slovenia offense. Tierney has taken a close look at the Slovenia vs. Australia Olympic basketball matchup from all angles and is leaning under on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the Slovenia vs. Australia spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball picks and predictions at SportsLine. So which side of the Slovenia vs. Australia spread is a must-back?

Brazil came in as the second choice among oddsmakers for Olympics 2020 gold but has been more impressive in the tournament. Spain has looked fatigued and is struggling to score but boasts a ton of talent. Both had to fight hard to get here, with Brazil beating Mexico in a shootout after a 0-0 draw and Spain netting its goal in the 115th minute to beat Japan 1-0 in Tuesday's Tokyo 2020 semifinals. Each has won a gold medal, with each winning on its home turf -- Brazil at Rio 2016 and Spain at Barcelona 1992. Kickoff from Yokohama Stadium is set for 7:30 a.m ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Brazil as the slight +160 favorite (risk $100 to win $160) on the 90-minute money line in its latest Brazil vs. Spain odds, while Spain is the +190 underdog. The over-under for total goals scored is set at 1.5. Before you lock in your Spain vs. Brazil picks or 2020 Tokyo Olympics predictions, you need to see what consummate soccer insider Martin Green has to say. After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Since then, his European soccer picks have been spot-on. Green has generated nearly $19,000 for $100 bettors since the 2017-18 season, and he has his finger on the pulse of the game all over the globe. Now, Green has taken a close look at the Brazil vs. Spain matchup and revealed his 2020 Tokyo Olympics soccer picks. You can head to SportsLine now to see the picks. Here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Spain vs. Brazil: The Brazilians have lost two friendlies but have not lost in a competitive match in their last 12 (8-4-0) and are on a seven-game unbeaten run overall. They bunkered down against a tough Mexico squad but still had 67 percent possession and six shots on net before proving their class in the shootout. This under-23 team plays with the skill common of the Selecao senior team, with Everton's Richarlison and Hertha Berlin's Matheus Cunja forming a dangerous partnership up top. Richarlison is the tournament's top scorer with five goals, while Cunha has scored two. Brazil has won four medals in five appearances at the Summer Games, also winning two bronze and a silver, since the age restrictions were put in place in 1992. Spain has qualified just one other time since 2000, failing to advance in London in 2012. Brazil manager Andre Jardine chose to provide a safety net on defense for his young squad with his over-age selections. Captain Dani Alves, 38, and Sevilla's Diego Carlos, 28, anchor the unit, while 31-year-old goalkeeper Santos also provides leadership and has allowed just three goals in the five matches. The Spaniards have struggled to score goals, but the talent is certainly there. With Spanish law requiring club teams to release players for Olympic duty, the team had its pick of young players and three veterans. The squad includes six who played key roles in the team's Euro 2020 semifinal run last month. They have shown signs of fatigue, but they should find a second gear with gold on the line. The team also has plenty of depth if it ends up in extra time. Real Madrid's Marco Asensio, 25, is one of three over-age players and netted the winner against Japan. Asensio plays opposite Dani Olmo and Mikel Oyarzabal in a potent attack. Olmo also has a goal, while Oyarzabal has two, and Rafa Mir had a hat trick as a substitute to save the quarterfinal against Ivory Coast. Oyarzabal also can set up goals and has 19 assists over the past two seasons with Real Sociedad. Spain is solid in the back and has allowed just three goals in the five games. Barcelona's Eric Garcia and Villareal's Pau Torres are two of the world's best young defenders and are backed by Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Unai Simon. Green has taken a close look at the Brazil vs. Spain match from all sides, and he's leaning under on the goal total. He has two confident best bets and a full breakdown of this 2020 Tokyo Olympics gold-medal match. He's only sharing those expert soccer picks at SportsLine. So who wins Brazil vs. Spain? And where does all the betting value lie?

  "body": "Two teams will try to end their gold medal droughts in baseball when Team USA Baseball and Japan collide in the gold medal game of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on Saturday at Yokohama Baseball Stadium. The United States has not won gold in baseball since 2000 in Sydney. Meanwhile Japan has never won gold and has reached the gold medal game only once, in 1996. Baseball has been an Olympic sport since 1992 and was not contested in 2012 or '16. First pitch is set for 6 a.m. ET. Japan is the -200 favorite (risk $200 to win $100) in the latest USA vs. Japan odds from Caesars Sportsbook while the United States is the +170 underdog. The over-under for total runs scored is 8.5. Before making any Japan vs. United States picks, make sure you check out the Olympics 2020 predictions and betting advice from CBS Sports baseball guru Matt Snyder. A former player for Indiana University and a member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, Snyder has been a baseball writer with CBS Sports since 2011. CBS Sports' longest-tenured baseball expert combines simple logic learned from his baseball-playing days with an extensive background in analytics. He went 26-18 on his MLB picks in the 2020 MLB playoffs, including 8-4 on World Series bets. Now, Snyder has set his sights on the United States vs. Japan gold medal game and revealed his Olympic baseball picks and predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see his picks. Here are the Olympics baseball odds and betting trends for Japan vs. USA: The Japanese have their pitching lined up much better than the Americans. Japan has played one fewer game than the Americans and its pitchers have been rested since Wednesday -- all of its arms should be available. On Saturday the Japanese will start Masato Morishita, who allowed just two runs on five hits over five innings against Mexico on July 31. In addition, Hayato Sakamoto brings a hot bat into Saturday's game. The 32-year-old shortstop is batting .389 and leads the team in slugging (.722) and doubles (three). In Japan's 7-6 victory over the Americans on Monday he went 3-for-5 with one run and one RBI. The Americans have a favorable matchup against Morishita. The weakness in Team USA's lineup is striking out (50 strikeouts in 166 at-bats), but Morishita is not a swing-and-miss pitcher. He has just 77 strikeouts in 95.1 innings in his NPB season and struck out just three against Mexico in his only other start at the Olympics. In addition, Triston Casas has been on fire for the United States. A first baseman in the Red Sox organization, Casas leads all Olympians in home runs (three) and RBI (eight) and ranks third in slugging (.789). On Monday against Japan, Casas went 2-for-4 with two runs and three RBI. Snyder has broken down this matchup, and one of his picks is over for the run total. But he has discovered a critical X-factor that has him jumping all over one side of the run line. Head to SportsLine now to see his analysis and expert Olympic baseball picks. So who wins Japan vs. United States in the gold medal game? And where does all the betting value lie?

  "body": "While the gold medal won't be distributed until Saturday evening, there is more women's basketball action to monitor in the 2020 Summer Olympics. France takes on Serbia on Saturday morning in Tokyo, with a medal on the line. The teams faltered in the semifinals, but the bronze medal is up for grabs, leaving plenty to play for. Both teams have displayed versatility and resilience in the Olympics, with a competitive game likely in the offing. Tip-off is scheduled for 3 a.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists France as a two-point favorite in the latest France vs. Serbia odds. The over-under for total points is set at 142.5. Before finalizing any Serbia vs. France women's basketball picks or predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics rolling on, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Saturday's France vs. Serbia matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Serbia vs. France: France is one of the more efficient shooting teams in the Olympics to this point. The French are burying more than 78 percent of their free-throw attempts and, inside the arc, the French are converting 54.4 percent of their shots. They also have the edge in the passing department, with France averaging more assists (21.6 per game) and fewer turnovers (13.4 per game) than Serbia so far in Tokyo. Defensively, France has caused complete havoc for the opposition at times, including 9.2 steals per game in the tournament. Gabby Williams is the leader in that defensive attack, averaging 3.2 steals per game on her own, and the former top-five WNBA draft pick adds 9.4 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.6 assists per contest. Offensively, Sandrine Gruda is the team's centerpiece, leading the squad with 13.4 points per game on 63 percent shooting, and an impressive 6.2 rebounds per game. France is the more talented team on paper, and it\u00a0can lean on that advantage. As the reigning Eurobasket champions, the Serbian side is not afraid of the moment. The Serbians are incredibly balanced offensively, and there is also star power in play. Sonja Vasic the face of the squad, and she won the Eurobasket MVP to go along with the team's triumph. Vasic is averaging 9.8 points and a team-leading 6.4 rebounds per game in Tokyo, and she is connecting on 45.5 percent of her 3-point attempts. Yvonne Anderson is the team's leading scorer, averaging 12.0 points per game, but five players are averaging at least 6.4 points per contest. All told, a large part of Serbia's effectiveness has come defensively, and it will need to continue that. This is a team known for its grinding approach, and it can clamp down on France, or any opponent, for long stretches of time. Tierney has taken a close look at the Serbia vs. France Olympic basketball matchup from all angles and is leaning under on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball predictions at SportsLine.

  "body": "Team USA Basketball, led by a host of NBA stars, aims to win the gold medal on Friday evening. The United States faces France in the men's championship contest at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, with sky-high anticipation. Team USA is the significant favorite as the Americans aim for a fourth-straight gold medal. France is the challenger, though it is led by several talented NBA players, headlined by Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier. Tip-off is scheduled for 10:30 p.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Team USA Basketball as a 12.5-point favorite in the latest USA vs. France odds. The over-under for total points is set at 175.5.

He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the 2020 Olympic basketball odds and betting trends for France vs. USA: In expected fashion, the United States team has been virtually unguardable throughout the tournament. Team USA is averaging 101.4 points per game while leading the entire field in assists (25.6 per game), assist-to-turnover ratio (2.5), field-goal percentage (50.7 percent) and 3-point percentage (41.0 percent). The Americans are also shooting a blistering 59 percent on 2-point attempts, and they have tough shotmakers all over the roster when the opposing defense responds. Team USA is also facing a French team that has committed the most fouls in the tournament, and the United States is shooting 81 percent at the charity stripe in Tokyo. Individually, Kevin Durant leads the way with 19.0 points per game on elite-level shooting efficiency, and Jayson Tatum adds 14.4 points per game on 42 percent shooting from 3-point range. Jrue Holiday, Bam Adebayo and Draymond Green anchor an elite defense when engaged, and the Americans flashed their incredible upside in turning a deficit into a comfortable lead against Australia. While it cannot match the United States player-for-player, France is a talented and cohesive team. The French have been highly efficient from a shooting standpoint in Tokyo, making 48 percent from the floor, 39 percent from 3-point range and 79 percent from the free-throw line. France is also an excellent rebounding team, including 11.4 offensive rebounds per contest during its Olympic run, and the team is anchored by Gobert. The Utah Jazz center is arguably the best defensive player in the basketball world, and he is also putting up 11.4 points and 9.6 rebounds per game during the tournament. Offensively, France also has intriguing talent, with Evan Fournier averaging 19.2 points per game on efficient shooting and former NBA guard Nando De Colo putting up 13.8 points and 6.0 assists per contest. Finally, do-it-all forward Nic Batum brings versatility and experience to the table, and he'll likely be tasked with defensive assignments against the top American perimeter players.

  "body": "The Dominican Republic will try to earn its first Olympic medal in baseball when it takes on South Korea in the bronze medal game of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on Saturday at Yokohama Baseball Stadium. The Dominicans are playing in the Olympics for just the second time. In their only other appearance, in 1992, they finished sixth. Meanwhile South Korea won the gold medal the last time that baseball was an Olympic sport, in 2008 in Beijing. First pitch is set for 11 p.m. ET on Friday. South Korea is the -160 favorite (risk $160 to win $100) in the latest South Korea vs. Dominican Republic odds from Caesars Sportsbook while the Dominican Republic is the +140 underdog. The over-under for total runs scored is 8.5. Before finalizing any South Korea vs. Dominican Republic picks, be sure to check out the Olympics predictions and betting advice from CBS Sports baseball guru Matt Snyder. A former player for Indiana University and a member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, Snyder has been a baseball writer with CBS Sports since 2011. CBS Sports' longest-tenured baseball expert combines simple logic learned from his baseball-playing days with an extensive background in analytics. He went 26-18 on MLB picks in the 2020 MLB playoffs, including 8-4 on World Series bets. Now, Snyder has set his sights on Dominican Republic vs. South Korea. You can head to SportsLine to see his picks. Here are the 2020 Olympics baseball odds and betting trends for South Korea vs. Dominican Republic: The defending gold medalists will be getting their second look at Dominican Republic starter Raul Valdes. On Sunday the South Koreans put a lot of traffic on the bases with seven hits and three walks in 5.1 innings against Valdes but managed just one run. Seeing Valdes for the second time in seven days should work to South Korea's advantage. In addition the South Koreans have been getting contributions up and down the lineup. Hyunsoo Kim, who played with the Orioles and Twins in the majors, has been the team's best hitter (.385 average, .731 slugging percentage, two home runs and six RBI). But Hae Min Park is batting .400 (fifth best in the tournament) and has scored a tournament-best six runs, while Ji Hwan Oh is slugging .684 with two home runs and five RBI. The Dominicans have been the best fielding team in the tournament. They have committed just one error over five games and have a fielding percentage of .994. The combination of defense and strong pitching has helped them limit opponents to just 17 runs in Tokyo. In addition the Dominicans have been the stronger pitching team so far in the tournament. They rank second in the field in ERA, at 3.56. By comparison the South Koreans have a 4.50 ERA over six games. Snyder has broken down this matchup, and one of his picks is under for the run total (8.5). But he has discovered a critical X-factor that has him jumping all over one side of the money line. Head to SportsLine to see his analysis and top Olympic baseball picks. So who wins South Korea vs. Dominican Republic? And where does all the betting value lie?

  "body": "The Olympics provide inspirational stories and/or tales of sacrifice so frequently, it can often feel like they are a prerequisite for qualification. As a result, it's natural to sometimes become a bit numb to the trope. Nevertheless, every Olympics gives way to a handful of stories that break through to the mainstream and once more help shape our appreciation for how much these elite human beings endure, what they train for to have a chance at glory in their sport and on a global stage once every four (or, in this case, five) years. The Olympics' final weekend in Tokyo brought one of those moments. At these Games, there might not be an athlete embodying a story with a greater combination of sacrifice, courage and long-lasting impact for others than the ever-revered Allyson Felix. The 35-year-old queen of American track is one for the ages. On Friday, Felix ran the women's 400-meter final in 49.46 seconds to capture her first Olympic bronze medal and add to a legendary career. Then, Saturday night at Olympic Stadium, Felix ran the second leg of a loaded women's 4x400 relay team. Everyone on the team had a gold to their name entering the race, including 2021 breakout stars Sydney McLaughlin and Athing Mu, who won their golds earlier in the week. The fourth member, Dalilah Muhammad, won gold in the 400-meter hurdles in 2016 and took silver behind McLaughlin on Wednesday. The U.S. quartet blew the field away. With Mu anchoring the relay, Team USA crossed first in 3:16.85. That gold-winning performance put Felix on an echelon all to her own in Olympic history. With this being her final Olympics, Felix will finish with 11 medals -- the most of any track and field athlete in history. Seven golds, three silvers and a bronze. Her longevity is phenomenal. Track sports are normally not for the aged, yet here is Felix -- who just became the oldest U.S. woman to ever win a gold track medal -- with at least one podium appearance in five consecutive Olympics. That's only been done by two other athletes: Jamaican track stars Merlene Ottey and Veronica Campbell-Brown. For four consecutive Olympics, from 2008-2021, Felix won a gold medal. Unprecedented in American track history. On Friday, in the 400, Felix got it done by running like the exceptional, resilient veteran she is, doing so from all the way out in Lane 9. That's not the spot most sprinters win medals from. But as we've seen for well over a decade: Felix isn't most sprinters. The greatest runner in women's track history held her elongated turn with confident pace and never relented on her speed in the final 50 meters. Not only was it fast enough for a bronze, it was Felix rising to a necessary Olympic level once more in order to find the podium. That 49.46 sprint was Felix's fastest 400 time in six years -- meaning she ran better in Tokyo as a 35-year-old mom than when she took the silver in this event in 2016 at the age of 30. It was, in fact, the second-fastest 400 Felix ran in her life. From Lane 9. Remarkable. Bahamian Shaunae Miller-Uibo won gold (48.36), while Marileidy Paulino, of the Dominican Republic, took silver (49.20). Felix's 11 medals don't just distinguish her in terms of track athletes; she's forever in a special pantheon of all-time greats throughout sports. Friday's bronze tied her with none other than Carl Lewis for the most track and field medals by an American in history, and then Saturday marked the fourth consecutive Olympics that Felix won gold as a member of the women's 4x400 squad. Team USA has won gold in seven straight Olympics in that event. Yet, as recently as a few years ago, almost nobody thought she'd be here. Between her last appearance on an Olympic stage in Rio de Janeiro and now, Felix affected change throughout the world of track and field. She stood up to a multi-billion-dollar corporation. She testified to Congress about inequalities and child mortality rates in the Black community, doing so after overcoming her own serious pregnancy health scare. After the 2016 Games, when Felix won two golds and a silver, she knew it was time: she wanted to start her family. The decision to have a child has affected the careers of countless female track athletes over the decades. For most, it signaled an end to their Olympic aspirations. Felix didn't believe that should have to be her reality -- nor anyone else's going forward, if they didn't want it to be -- and she didn't want the $30 billion corporation sponsoring her, Nike, to think that was the case either. But that's not what happened. In 2018, as Felix was training in secret and avoiding initially revealing her pregnancy to Nike, she was also in negotiations for a new contract. She didn't believe it to be right for Nike to have the power to significantly reduce how much she would be paid in the future based off her performance while pregnant and during her postpartum period. Nike balked. It didn't agree. With motherhood now in Felix's near future, Nike was clear: the company would not be open to continuing to sponsor and pay Felix the same way going forward. Here was an all-time Olympian just two years removed from amassing more Olympic golds than any female track athlete in history, and she was being bullied out of a deal. Nike was prepared to cut the terms of Felix's endorsement by as much as 70%. In light of what Felix has done since, this now amounts to one of the more embarrassing marketing miscalculations of the past decade in all of sports. It was also narrow-minded and discriminatory. The decision obviously angered Felix, who became inspired to speak out, and in doing so, violated the terms of her non-disclosure agreement with the company. It would mean the end of her endorsement deal with the most powerful apparel brand company on the planet.\u00a0She first spoke out in a New York Times op-ed, in a moment of true courage that was in some ways precedent-setting. After all, how often do we see an athlete speak out against a company that endorses them? For Felix, the battle was always bigger than money. It was about making people understand that just because it's women who carry the burden of bearing children, it shouldn't mean women should also have to accept endorsement and earning restrictions based off their performance as mothers or mothers-to-be. Felix left Nike, signed with Athleta, and within months the uproar was so loud that Nike wound up changing its policy regarding female athletes and contractual agreements tied to childbirth. By then it was too late for Nike to keep Felix. Amid all of this, she was forced to have an emergency cesarean section seven months into her pregnancy because of a potentially life-threatening condition brought on by high blood pressure. Her baby daughter, Camryn, had to live for more than a month in the NICU. In late June, after Felix rallied to qualify for the Olympics for a fifth time -- with 2-year-old Camryn on hand to watch -- she posted the photo below to Instagram. Draped in a god's haul of medals, there was also the deliberate artistic decision to include her C-section scar, as it's now a significant part of her story and a mark on her body that represents so much of what she went through over the past three years to get to this point. \"I used my voice and built this company for you. So that you never have to train at 4:30am while you're 5 months pregnant to hide your pregnancy from your sponsor,\" Felix wrote. \"The world doesn't need more shoes, but the world does need to see women wholly and meet them right where they are.\" When Felix crossed the finish line Friday, and when she stepped to the podium to receive her gold on Saturday, she did so wearing her own new shoe, the Saysh One. It was designed by her own company and with a team of women who created the product. What happened this weekend at Olympic Stadium was so much more than a couple of age-defying sprints by the greatest female track star of all time. Friday's 400 took 49.46 seconds to finish, but in reality this is a race that started years ago. Thanks to Allyson Felix, we can actually start to see the finish line.",

  "body": "The Canadian women's national soccer team became Olympic gold medalists after winning a dramatic penalty-kick shootout in the final against Sweden. The two teams played to a 1-1 draw in regulation and were unable to break through during two periods of extra time. Stina Blackstenius scored in regulation for Sweden, and Jessie Fleming converted a penalty kick for the equalizer. The two sides both had a strong showing in the first half, as each team spent time in each other's half, though Sweden did far more with their opportunities in the final third. Blackstenius broke the deadlock in the 34th minute, as the Europeans led Canada in total shots (11-3), despite splitting possession at 50%. Canada's opportunity to equalize came way via penalty as Swedish defender Amanda Lestedt made contact on Christine Sinclair inside the box and VAR confirmed the foul. Fleming converted the penalty in the 67th minute, as Canada remained active in front of goal during stoppage time of regulation. Fatigue settled in each during the two halves of extra time, and substitutions nearly made the difference as Deanne Rose and Jordyn Huitema had chances for Canada and Lina Hurtig nearly connected on set pieces for Sweden, but the game headed to penalties to determine the gold medal. Sweden entered the gold medal match unbeaten in their Tokyo campaign and winners of five consecutive matches ahead of the Olympic final. In the build-up to the final, the team did not need penalty kicks to decide any of their knockout stage games. Canada's journey to the gold medal match presented narrow draws, extra-time scenarios, and penalty kicks. As the two Olympic finalists traded makes and misses (both teams missed three consecutive spot kicks at one point), and each keeper made saves. Candian keeper Stephanie Labb\u00e9 made a huge save on Sweden's Andersson, and Julia Grosso converted her attempt to give Canada the Olympic gold for the first time in their history. Sinclair, the all-time leading goal scorer in international soccer, made her exit in the gold medal match during regulation in the 87th minute to make way for Huitema and was unavailable for penalty kick selection. The longtime captain missed a penalty kick earlier in the knockout stage, and when penalty opportunities were presented to Canada in the semifinal and gold medal final, her leadership came into play, collecting the ball and passing it off to Fleming to convert. The 23-year-old midfielder executed each time on her penalties during the Olympics. For the 38-year-old Sinclair, this was possibly her final game for Canada in a major tournament, capping off a historic international career with an Olympic gold medal to go along with her two bronze medals from the 2012 and 2016 Summer Games.",

  "body": "Team USA and France are the last two teams standing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and as such they will go head-to-head for the gold medal. The contest between the U.S. and France will serve as a rematch, as the two teams also met in the first game of group play last month. In that game, France pulled out a 83-76 win, thanks largely to Evan Fournier, who had a game-high 28 points on 11 of 22 shooting from the floor. Rudy Gobert also added 14 points and nine rebounds of his own. As a team, France shot an impressive 47 percent from the floor. It outscored the U.S. 46-31 in the second half, and went on a16-2 run to close out the game and secure the win. The group stage loss was actually the United States' second straight to France in international play, as the French also prevailed over the U.S. in the 2019 FIBA World Cup. Given the way their last couple of meetings played out, it's safe to say that the Americans will be seeking revenge -- in addition to a gold medal. Falling to France was the only defeat that the U.S. suffered during these Olympics, while the French team has yet to lose a game. Here's everything you need to know about the gold medal game between the United States and France. Date:\u00a0Friday, Aug. 6\u00a0|\u00a0Time:\u00a010:30 p.m. ETLocation:\u00a0Saitama Super Arena -- Saitama, Japan\u00a0TV:\u00a0NBC and Peacock\u00a0|\u00a0Live stream:\u00a0fuboTV (Try for free)Odds:\u00a0USA -900; FRA +600\u00a0|\u00a0O/U:\u00a0175.5 (via William Hill Sportsbook) United States: Team USA has been playing much better basketball since they lost to France at the start of group play, but it will take a full 40-minute effort if the Americans are going to exact their revenge and claim a fourth consecutive gold medal. One obvious adjustment that the U.S. will have to make? They need to do a much better job of defending Fournier, who was the best player on the floor the first two the two teams met. Fournier hit big bucket after big bucket for France, and ultimately his production was a major determining factor in the contest. In all, he finished with a game-high 28 points while shooting 50 percent from the floor (11 of 22). He also knocked down four 3s and grabbed four rebounds. After the game, Fournier\u00a0provided an honest assessment\u00a0of Team USA. \"They are better individually but they can be beaten as a team,\" he said. It will now be up to Team USA to prove Fournier wrong, and limiting his offensive production will help their cause. They'll also have to shoot better than they did in the first game. The U.S. shot just 36 percent from the floor in that contest, compared to 47 percent from France. In a game that was decided by seven points, this made a big difference. France: It's tough to overstate how big of an opportunity the French team has here. France has won a silver medal in Olympic play twice (1948, 2000), but it has never won gold. Now, the only thing standing between the French and their first gold is a team that they've already bested in these very Olympics. Both times the French team has finished with the Silver Medal they lost to the U.S. in the championship game, so in a way they're seeking some revenge of their own. To get it, they'll need big games from Fournier, Gobert, Nic Batum and all of their other key contributors. The U.S. has been playing better basketball as the Olympics have gone on, and as such they're not the same team that dropped their Olympic opener to France late last month. They've found an identity on the defensive end, and their shot making has been there when it's mattered most. The French team is excellent, but at the end of the day the U.S. is the more talented team, and they should be able to take care of business. Pick: United States -12.5",

  "body": "Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers lended his support to U.S. gymnast Simone Biles on Friday, three days after she took home a bronze medal for finishing third in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics' women's balance beam final. The reigning NFL MVP's praise of Biles extended beyond her work on the mat. In an interview with The Ringer, Rodgers credited Biles' ability to speak freely about her mental health and advocate the same for others. \"I give Simone so much credit for her ability to speak the truth, her truth, and to answer tough questions, and to have the courage to say, 'I'm scared' and 'I don't feel like I should be out there,'\" Rodgers said. \"She's the greatest gymnast of all time. And mental health [awareness] is an issue that is continuing to break down the stigmas that don't allow us to talk about it or only allow us to talk about it in a super negative, depressive, suicidal way. \"People of all ages and all professions are dealing with mental issues, especially during COVID... it's something we should be talking about and ways to help people get through it, whether it's techniques or therapy or just conversations letting people know they're not alone. And that's what Simone did. I'm very, very proud of her.\" Biles, who withdrew from four finals for mental health reasons, was seen supporting teammates Suni Lee, MyKala Skinner and Jade Carey throughout their respective runs that ended in winning Olympic hardware. That American group won silver in the team competition, without Biles, preceding the individual events. Athletes, Rodgers claims, have higher platforms to deliver important messages such as mental health advocacy. Biles has spoken extensively on that very subject these Games, doing everything from explaining what the \"twisties\" are to outlining her personal struggles with the yips-like issue. Talking like Biles has is a trend Rodgers, who has \"gotten to know her a little bit at times over the years,\" hopes continues. \"Well, we should keep talking about it,\" Rodgers said. \"Keep talking about ways that we individually deal with stress and deal with anxiety and deal with pressure and deal with depression or loneliness. I think that would really help. Because we, whether we like it or not, have a platform to influence people. \"And our words are often listened to more than the person who's not in the public eye as much. So we have an opportunity -- not an obligation, an opportunity -- to maybe share some of our own ways of dealing with things and break some of the stigma around mental health.\"",

  "body": "Gable Steveson's Olympic run in the freestyle wrestling heavyweight division was already impressive entering his gold medal match with Geno Petriashvili on Friday. After what he pulled off in the match with Petriashvili, Steveson's efforts have him bordering on being an Olympic wrestling legend. Steveson was down 8-5 with less than 30 seconds remaining but pulled off two takedowns to win the match, 10-8. The second takedown will go down as an all-time great moment in the history of amateur wrestling. Still down 8-7 with 6.5 seconds remaining, Steveson pressured before turning the corner and securing the winning takedown inside the final second of the match. Here's a look at how it played out: The win completed an amazing 2020 Games for Steveson. The 21-year-old had not allowed an opponent to score a single point against him in the three rounds prior to the gold medal match. That included an 8-0 win over 2016 Olympic gold medalist Taha Akgul of Turkey. Steveson has not lost an international match in two years and is now the first American heavyweight to win Olympic gold since Bruce Baumgartner in 1992. \"I took him down and I saw there was about 10 seconds left,\" Steveson said after his win. \"I got off him, ref blew the whistle and at that point it was do or die, and I just had to go. I can't even describe it, I'm somewhere else right now. \"I knew I had it in me. I knew I had it in me. Everybody talks about bringing home a gold medal, and I did it.\"",

That contest, along with more than a half dozen track and field finals, make Friday a day to watch in Tokyo. Here's everything you missed from Thursday, Day 14 of the Olympic Games -- including the continuation of Team USA women's basketball's historic run -- and what to follow on Day 15. Stay up to date with how countries are performing at the Games by checking out our medal counter. The U.S. claimed its fourth gold in the last five Olympics with a win over Australia late Thursday. April Ross and Alix Klineman -- the Southern California natives nicknamed the \"A-Team\" because their first names both start with the letter A -- won their seventh consecutive match, with this one coming in straight sets, 21-15, 21-16. This was Ross' second Olympic medal and first gold, while it's Klineman's first. Former \"A-Team\" member Mr. T approves. Team USA throttled Serbia, 79-59, in Thursday's semifinal and is now one win away from its seventh consecutive gold medal. Brittney Griner led the squad with 15 points and 12 rebounds, while Breanna Stewart added a double-double of her own with 12 points and 10 boards.  The Americans are on the verge of history, as only one Olympic team before them -- in any sport -- has won seven gold medals in a row (U.S. men's basketball, 1936-68). The win over Serbia was Team USA's 54th straight. The Americans will battle the winner of France-Japan in the gold medal game on Saturday at 10:30 p.m. ET. The American's found success on the indoor volleyball court in addition to the sand, as it defeated Serbia in straight sets to reach the gold medal game.

  "body": "The United States women's basketball team showed why they're the No. 1 ranked team in the world on Friday morning with another dominant performance. They beat Serbia 79-59 in the semifinals to advance to the gold medal game at the Tokyo Olympics and run their historic Olympics winning streak to 54 games. After an even first couple of minutes, Team USA went on a 7-0 run to take a lead they would never relinquish. They led 26-12 after the first quarter, and save for a brief portion of the second, they maintained that double-digit advantage for the rest of the way. Much like the quarterfinal against Australia, the game was out of hand for the entire second half. It wasn't the prettiest offensive display Team USA has ever had, but it was more than good enough with the way they were playing defense. This was a truly elite defensive performance from the Americans, as they flew around in passing lanes, protected the paint and largely disrupted everything Serbia was trying to do. They held Serbia to just 59 points on 30 shooting from the field, and forced 12 turnovers. If it wasn't for a strong effort on the offensive glass, in which they earned 10 second-chance points, the outcome would have been even worse for Serbia. As per usual, Team USA worked inside-out and were led by the frontcourt. Brittney Griner continued her strong play in Tokyo with 15 points and 12 rebounds for her second double-double of the tournament. Breanna Stewart added a double-double of her own with 12 points and 10 rebounds, while Chelsea Gray came off the bench to put up 14 points in her best performance so far. Now, Team USA will play for a historic seventh straight gold medal on Saturday against the winner of the second semifinal between France and Japan. Team USA has already beaten both of those teams in the group stage, and that was when they were still trying to figure some things out. With the way they've played since the knockout stage began, Team USA will be massive favorites to win it all no matter who they have to play.",

  "body": "Mexico won't get another gold medal, but it wants something to show for its efforts at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics when it faces host Japan in Friday's men's soccer bronze-medal match. Japan had hoped its brick-wall defense would put it in line for gold, but both teams came up just short. Mexico, the gold medalist at the 2012 London Games, lost in a shootout to Brazil after playing to 0-0 stalemate, while Japan also held Spain scoreless for 115 minutes before a stinging 1-0 loss. The teams met in the Tokyo 2020 group stage, and Japan went on to win the group on the strength of a 2-1 victory. Japan lost to South Korea in the bronze-medal match at those 2012 Olympics. Kickoff is set for 7:30 a.m ET at Saitama Stadium. Mexico is the slight +150 favorite (risk $100 to win $150) on the 90-minute money line in the latest Mexico vs. Japan odds from Caesars Sportsbook. Japan is the +170 underdog, while the over-under for total goals scored is 2.5. Before finalizing any Mexico vs. Japan picks or 2020 Tokyo Olympics predictions, you have to see what consummate soccer insider Martin Green has to say. After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Since then, his European soccer picks have been spot-on. Green has generated nearly $19,000 for $100 bettors since the 2017-18 season, and he has his finger on the pulse of the game all over the globe. Now, Green has taken a close look at the Japan vs. Mexico matchup and revealed his Olympics soccer best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see the picks. Here are the Olympic soccer odds and betting trends for Mexico vs. Japan: El Tri played a strong match in the group-stage meeting but couldn't catch up after going down by two goals early. A converted penalty in the 12th minute put Japan up 2-0 in the 12th minute, and a second-half Johan Vazquez red card left Mexico playing with 10 men for more than 20 minutes. El Tri dominated possession, but could not find the goals. It also buckled down to hold a powerful Brazil team without a goal for 120 minutes before falling on penalties. Now it faces a Japan team that could be discouraged not to have a chance at gold in its home event. Both teams have been known for their defense, but the Mexicans have more attacking talent. Midfielder Luis Romo is the engine of the offense, while fellow Mexican Liga MX star Henry Martin is the finisher. Romo had a goal and two assists in a 6-3 win against South Korea in the quarterfinals, while Martin is tied for the team lead with Francisco Cordova after scoring three goals in the five matches. Goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa, Martin's teammate with Liga MX contender Club America, is one of the team's leaders and is a steady presence in the net. The Japanese squad has been organized and efficient, allowing just two goals in the five games. It held Mexico off the score sheet for the first 85 minutes in the July 25 win and did not concede to Spain until late in extra time. The loss to the Spaniards snapped a nine-game unbeaten run that saw Japan yield just three goals while scoring 24. This team is built for defense, with backs Maya Yoshida and Hiroki Sakai joining fierce defensive midfielder Wataru Endo as the three over-age players on the roster. Japan is 7-3-4 in its last three Olympics appearances. Japan also is seeking revenge against Mexico after El Tri ousted it from London 2012 on its way to the gold medal. It will have the entire nation behind it and knows from last month's victory that it can take the bronze medal if it executes the same way. Japan took a 2-0 lead in the first 12 minutes then sat back to defend. Mexico controlled the ball for 62 percent of the match but had just four shots on target. Takefusa Kubo, a 20-year-old prospect who is trying to earn playing time with Real Madrid, scored the first goal. That was the second of his three in the tournament. Green has examined the Japan vs. Mexico match from every angle and has revealed a pair of best bets.\u00a0He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine.

  "body": "A spot in the gold-medal game is on the line when France takes on Japan in women's basketball on Friday in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Both teams are trying to unseat the heavily favored United States squad, but they must first defeat the other. France defeated Spain in the quarterfinals. Japan knocked off Belgium to advance to this point. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 a.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists France as a three-point favorite in the Japan vs. France odds. The over-under, or total number of points expected, is 149. Before finalizing any France vs. Japan basketball picks or predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics rolling on, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Friday's France vs. Japan matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Japan vs. France: Japan's only loss in the tournament came against the United States and the Japanese are playing with confidence. They knocked off Belgium by a one-point margin and, in the process, reached the Olympic semifinals for the first time. Moreover, Japan isn't shy about its ambition. \"Four and a half years ago, I said my goal, my dream, is to beat America in the Tokyo Olympics in the championship game,\" Japan head coach Thomas Wayne Hovasse told the media after the quarterfinal win. \"Everybody laughed at me. I don't know, there might be some people starting to believe now.\" France has been up-and-down at times during the Olympics, but managed to escape with a narrow defeat over Spain in the quarterfinals. The French played very well down the stretch and, overall, France has played with improved tempo in Tokyo when compared to previous tournaments. Defensively, France is generating havoc on a consistent basis, and that is manifested with 8.8 steals per game, a top-three mark in the tournament. On the offensive end, France is balanced in nature, with four players averaging in double figures. Sandrine Gruda leads the way to this point, averaging 12.5 points per game and shooting 60 percent from the floor. Gruda is also an excellent rebounder, picking up 7.0 caroms per game. Elsewhere, Gabby Williams has been excellent, putting up 10.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and a whopping 3.3 steals per game. Tierney has taken a close look at the Japan vs. France Olympic basketball matchup from all angles and is leaning over on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball predictions at SportsLine.

  "body": "Team USA is back on top of the women's beach volleyball world. Americans April Ross and Alix Klineman beat Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho del Solar of Australia in straight sets on Thursday night to win gold in the event. For the U.S., it is their first gold in women's beach volleyball since the legendary tandem of Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings were the last team standing at the 2012 Games in London. For May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings, that 2012 win was their straight gold medal in the event. This may be the start of a similar stretch for Ross and Klineman. The Americans did not lose a single set in their elimination matches en route to the final, and against the pair of Australians, it was much of the same story. After taking the first set, 21-15, Ross and Klineman went down 2-0 to begin the second frame. Then, they turned it on and went on a 10-1 scoring run to create some distance. The Australians fought back and came to within 20-16 in the second set. But that would be as close as they came, as the Americans scored on match point to win the final. \"It's so tough,\" Ross said. \"It was such a shot in the dark. For us to get here and do this, with this kind of competition just blows my mind. To get a gold medal finally, feels so amazing\" For Ross, 39, it was her third Olympic medal and her first gold. She won silver with Jen Kessy at the 2012 Games and took home a bronze at the 2016 Olympics alongside her partner, the aforementioned Walsh Jennings. The win in Tokyo also makes Ross the oldest women to win a gold at the Olympics in any type of volleyball event. As for Klineman, the Tokyo Games were the first Olympics she has ever competed in. \"I still don't know if i really ever expected this to come true,\" Klineman said. \"It feels like such a fairy tale.\"",

  "body": "One of the under-focused aspects of Simone Biles' trouble at the Tokyo Olympics was that her moment of vulnerability and mental strife happened far, far away from many of the people who are closest to her. One of those people is Houston Texans safety Jonathan Owens, Biles' boyfriend, who opened up about his feelings on the situation to reporters at Texans training camp on Thursday. According to a report by the Houston Chronicle, Owens shared that he had been able to communicate with Biles while she was competing in Tokyo, and did his best to try and keep her positive and motivated while she dealt with the \"twisties\" in addition to other mental stresses that forced her to withdraw from several gymnastics competitions. Owens also stated that he had a sense of what was going on when Biles withdrew from team competition. \"I remember it was early in the morning, and my heart was really  beating because I could see her face, and I kind of know her facial  expressions,\" Owens said. \"I could kind of read her lips and know what was  going on and what she was telling her coach. I kind of already knew what was going on beforehand, so I  was just hoping she was going to get over it and be able to go out  there and perform. \"I was sick to my stomach because she wasn't able to  go out there. I know her teammates really wanted her out there, but she  made the best decision for herself, so I support whatever she does.\" After sitting out for an extended period of time, Biles returned and earned bronze in the balance beam final. That marked the seventh Olympic medal of her career. As Biles prepares to return home to the United States, Owens is trying to make the Houston Texans' 53-man roster after spending the past two years splitting time between the team's active roster and practice squad. A former undrafted free agent out of Missouri Western, Owens has played in seven career NFL games, primarily as a special teamer.",

  "body": "The United States looks to continue an unprecedented Olympic winning streak in women's basketball. The Americans have won 53 straight games, and they will put that run on the line on Friday. Team USA takes on Serbia in the semifinals, with the winner advancing to the gold medal game. Serbia picked up a tournament win in Eurobasket earlier this year. Tip-off is scheduled for 12:40 a.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Team USA women's basketball as the 17.5-point favorite in the USA vs. Serbia odds. The over-under for total points is set at 158.5. Before finalizing any Serbia vs. Team USA women's basketball picks or predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics rolling on, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Friday's USA vs. Serbia matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Serbia vs. USA: Team USA seems to be peaking at the right time. The Americans walloped Australia by a 21-point margin in the quarterfinal and, for the most part, they've made it look easy in Tokyo, even when they didn't have their \"A\" game on full display. No team, including Serbia, can come close to matching Team USA in terms of individual talent and, with every passing day, the potential gap in cohesion when compared to more seasoned teams could be closing. The United States leads the tournament in scoring, assists and field-goal percentage, showcasing its ultimate offensive ceiling. On top of that, Team USA has shown that it is fully capable of locking up defensively at times during the tournament. The Serbians are worthy opponents, but they haven't flashed the offensive ceiling required to take out the United States in a setting that is remotely near the projections. Team USA just has too much firepower for most opponents to contend with, even at the highest levels. Serbia has regularly shown its resilience in this tournament, including a comeback win over China in the quarterfinals. The reigning Eurobasket champions bring a balanced scoring attack to the table but, more than anything, the Serbians done it with defense in Tokyo. They are grinding things out by contesting shots and being tougher than their opponents, with Serbia averaging only 71 points per game and still winning. Sonja Vasic is the team's leader and, in addition to averaging 11.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game in the Olympics, she is the reigning Eurobasket MVP. Jelena Brooks leads the team in scoring at 13.5 points per game in the tournament, and Serbia can also take solace in ball control issues and periods of inconsistency from the high-powered American side. Tierney has taken a close look at the Team USA vs. Serbia Olympic basketball matchup from all angles and is leaning over on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball predictions at SportsLine. So who wins USA vs. Serbia? And which side of the spread is a must-back?

Thinking back to the \u201990s, trailblazing stylists like Melanie Ward, Venetia Scott, and Edward Enninful brought a fresh sense of realism to fashion editorials. All three grew up in London, and captured the mood of the city\u2019s eclectic street style, lending a decidedly raw edge and vibrant personality to the polished minimalism that ruled the runways of the time. They also put forward new designers and models in the process. Now Vogue\u2019s European editorial director, Enninful often styled his i-D covers with grungy thrift store finds, and on talents such as the British-born rapper Monie Love and Nigerian model Oluchi Onweagba. He made a point of collaborating with Black creatives, in a moment when they were systematically ignored by the industry. Thirty years on, and it seems a seismic shift of similar proportions is underway in fashion. Following a global pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests of last summer, many in the industry are hungry for change. In New York, the cataclysmic events of the last 18 months have most certainly renewed the spirit of community. Among the new wave of creatives on scene, one crew of young stylist friends in particular is bringing a fresh perspective to the art of image-making. Meet Marion B. Kelly II, Milton D. Dixon III, Rasaan Wyzard, and Edward Bowleg III. The four Black creatives all met while assisting styling on various projects in New York over the past five or six years, and they now operate as a loose collective. \u201cWe\u2019re a support system for each other,\u201d says Milton. \u201cWe\u2019re a sounding board for ideas, advisors to each other for tough situations,a listening ear to vent and let frustrations out.\u201d While fashion talk is always on the table, they often find that their discussions on anything from politics to art can inspire them most. \u201cThe beauty of our friendship is being able to leave work at the door and talk about everything else,\u201d says Rassan. The four stylists have different aesthetics, but all use their work to highlight and uplift underrepresented talent. They\u2019ll spotlight Black models such as fresh new face Simone Embrack and fitness model Lu Faustin, and style them in cool, Black-owned labels of the moment\u2014think, Connor McKnight, Bianca Saunders, and Bed on Water\u2014many of whom they count as creative collaborators.

But they had a shared vision. \u201cDo you know what? We sort of came up with the same idea,\u201d says Kane. \u201cI knew she loved the \u201960s, and she was looking at brides like Sharon Tate, June Carter Cash, and Priscilla Presley. There\u2019s also something about the Holy Communion world, even though she\u2019s Jewish. For me, growing up in Scotland, it was a big deal. Your Holy Communion and the perfect little dress. It was so weird that children were dressed up in these bridal outfits. We liked that subversive world. That\u2019s what Lena loves too.\u201d The dress Dunham wore for the ceremony, the first of three, is laced with this subversive backstory. If you didn\u2019t know it, though, you\u2019d just see the bride. \u201cWhen she first walked out into the room where it was, people were really in awe. They really stood back and were crying,\u201d says the British designer, who struck up a friendship with Dunham after dressing her for the Met gala in 2019; she and Jemima Kirke attended the \u201cCamp\u201d-themed event with Kane, decked out in minidresses that read Rubberist and Looner, respectively, with latex gloves. When Kane met Dunham for her first fitting at her home, he had created multiple toiles of dresses for her to try on. He assumed they would need options. \u201cWhen you do brides, they think they know what they want, but then they go the opposite way,\u201d says Kane. \u201cSo you have to have all these options ready. Lena knew what she wanted, and she wasn\u2019t changing her mind. She tried it on and that was it. That was the one.\u201d The dress was modeled after look 54 from his fall 2019 runway show, with lace bishop sleeves and Kane\u2019s signature cupcake skirt (which dramatically puffs out thanks to layers of organza and crinoline). Paired with white tights, white shoes, and a floor-length veil affixed with a tiny bow, Dunham\u2019s look was, as Kane says, \u201calmost doll-like.\u201d Her grandmother\u2019s watch was sewn into the organza of the skirt: something blue. She wore her mother\u2019s Art Deco earrings and a pendant made from one of her grandmother\u2019s earrings as a necklace.",

Several agonizing pandemic-induced postponements later, Daniel Craig\u2019s last 007 film is finally hitting cinemas and the British actor who plays Miss Moneypenny is raring to go. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought of myself as someone more comfortable in casual attire, but one of the many surprising things I learnt about myself during the pandemic was that I love dressing up!\u201d Harris tells Vogue on premiere day. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all been secretly living in our dressing gowns, so it\u2019s great to now be out, dressing up and enjoying the world... and even walking the red carpet.\u201d Harris frosted her look with Ana Khouri jewellery and an Omega watch, with Jimmy Choo shoes to dial up the drama. For her turn in the spotlight, there was only one designer she trusted to make her a dress synonymous with the dynamism and mystique of the 007 franchise: Michael Kors. \u201cThe classic silhouettes and sophisticated elegance that Michael Kors is known for worldwide are a perfect marriage with the ultra high-end glamour of the Bond world,\u201d notes Naomie. The pearlescent hand-beaded, sequin-studded look is as exquisite as the fashion in the films and, she says, it \u201cmakes [her] feel like a million dollars\u201d. \u201cOne of the many surprising things I learnt about myself during the pandemic was that I love dressing up!\u201d says Harris. It turns out that Moneypenny also has a penchant for Michael\u2019s fashion. \u201cWe share a love of traditional style combined with [contemporary], quirky elements,\u201d says Harris, who has helped modernise the straight-talking private secretary since taking on the role in 2012\u2019s Skyfall. \u201cThe MK Bancroft handbag [which Moneypenny carries] is the perfect embodiment of that mixture of classic elegance and a bit of edge.\u201d Harris, resplendent in Michael Kors Collection, at the Leicester Square showcase. It was a rite of passage, then, to swing by the Michael Kors Regent Street store ahead of the Leicester Square showcase to pick up a shiny new Bancroft and mark the moment. Wearing a slinky, sparkly white twin set, Harris set the tone of what was to come at the landmark premiere: a kick-ass red-carpet look both power females would be proud of.

We\u2019re just saying, if you\u2019ve missed wearing high heels this year, now\u2019s the time time to dust them off and bring them out again. Below, are seven ways on how to wear them. If you\u2019re not quite ready for a stiletto yet, ease in with Maryam Nassir Zadeh\u2019s Olympia wedges\u2014an eternal It girl favorite. A kitten heel is a perfect foray back into heels; stay low to the ground with a style that blends sport and glamour. Add a ladylike mule with a pop of color to counteract that cool girl vibe you have going on top. You can always keep it cute with a sweet Mary Jane to soften up an edgy look. It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve rocked a classic stiletto pump, but we say go for it. If you\u2019re not quite committed to color, let your white embellished pump do the talking.

  "body": "The other weekend, I was at a party at which a friend\u2014mid-cheerful gesticulation\u2014accidentally spilled a can of Miller Lite on my feet. At one point, this would have been a minor emergency. I might not have hissed \"Ruin my satin shoes, why don't you?\" (Cher-Horowitz-from-Clueless style), but I definitely would have been annoyed (and if I'd been wearing my agonizingly uncomfortable yet beloved Intentionally Blank cheetah mules, may or may not have cried in the bathroom). As it was, though, I was able to shrug, smile, and fix the problem with a half cup of water. This, my friends, is the beauty of wearing black platform Crocs, made of easily washable Croslite. (They're not Balenciaga or any other designer collaboration, unfortunately, but I'd be more than willing to trade up at some point in the not-too-distant future.) I have, to put it mildly, always had capital S, capital P shoe problems. Throughout my high school and college years, I agonized about the size of my calves and the width of my ankles, resolving to wear shoes with only enough of a heel to make my legs look relatively long and sinuous (particularly when they were emerging from the stringy bottom of a thrifted house dress). This resolution was hard to keep, though. Sure, I could lace up my trusty Doc Martens throughout the winter months and kick on a pair of Danskos in spring, but what about summer? What was I supposed to wear to the beach while all my friends ran around in flip-flops and cute, delicately crafted sandals, a pair of rubber tires secured with string? Luckily, I'm not quite as body-conscious now as I was when I was 19, and to put it frankly, I really don't give a shit if my shoes make my legs look thin. What I do care about, though, is comfort, and I've never really found it in socks and sneakers, which tend to make me feel like a cranky eight-year-old boarding the bus for day camp. I had a brief dalliance with oxfords a few years ago, and tried to embrace Tevas as recently as last August, but I found them to be too precious and too crunchy, respectively. Despite my improved self-esteem, I can't help it; I still have a penchant for enormous shoes, particularly the kind that actually let me\u2014gasp\u2014walk around with more ease than my Docs or Danskos ever afforded. Enter the Crocs Bae Classic Platform Clog, which I started spotting around Brooklyn on all manner of cool people sometime last year. When I heard people I trust online\u2014specifically, Vice's Sara David, platform Croc queen extraordinaire\u2014praise their walkability, I was sold. Tragically, I wasn't able to secure my own pair online until this past July due to the frequency with which they sell out online, but once they arrived at my house and I slid them onto my feet, I knew I wouldn't be taking them off anytime soon. (Okay, hyperbole. I do clean them, and I sleep barefoot, but the rest of my time is pretty much be-Crocced.)",

Consider it a four-city, month-long survey, if you will. Among the bags toted is a lovely mix of reinterpreted classics as well as new and noteworthy styles. The lady bag gets a modern makeover for 2021, while everyday silhouettes like small cross-body bags are offered in on-trend seasonal materials. There are also of-the-moment bags that offer a timeless appeal\u2014like the return of the Gucci Diana and Loewe Amazona bags\u2014both re-issued from the house\u2019s archives. A handful of styles share common practical themes, like the use of neutral-colored leathers and sizing that could be classified as mid to roomy. Characteristics like these make investing in trends easy, especially when you\u2019ll be able to wear them for many seasons to come. However, it wouldn\u2019t be a trend report without something statement-worthy. Holding true to the holiday season spirit, mini bags that get a maxi dose of sparkle. If you buy a new bag this season, consider one of these fall 2021 handbag trends below. This fall, you\u2019ll want to pack light. Consider smaller-sized bags that resemble vintage luggage. In handheld-size duffles and top-handled trunks, these might just be your new favorite carry-on. We\u2019ve already expressed our love for wearing shades of brown this season, so why not continue the autumnal color trend with a handbag in rich shades of suede? Let your belongings fall into a fashionable abyss with the season\u2019s assortment of ultra-roomy totes\u2014not to worry; they\u2019re not actually bottom-less. Consider styles from Carolina Santo Domingo to Khaite. Squishable, pillow-like clutches return with a bit of structure with the addition of elegant hardware like gold clasped frames and optional chains. One of the most carried bags this year was the Gucci Diana. These lady-like bags come with contemporary details like two-tone interiors, oversized buckles, and stretched-out silhouettes. Sling a mid-sized flap-closure satchel from The Row to Prada over your shoulder and be on your way. While small in size, high-shine silver embellishments\u2014such as crystals fringe and paillette sequins ensure\u2014that this season\u2019s mini bags won\u2019t go unnoticed.",

  "body": "As the host of SNL, Kim Kardashian made waves as soon as she started her opening monologue, which was full of cheeky digs at herself, the whole Kardashian clan, and her former husband Kanye West. The audience\u2014and the internet\u2014ate it up. Just as buzzworthy was the statement look Kardashian wore to perform it. The style star hit the SNL stage in a hot pink velvet catsuit by Balenciaga that had her fully covered from the turtleneck down to the heels. But that wasn\u2019t the only Balenciaga look she wore that day. Kardashian wore a trifecta of ensembles that proved her ongoing love affair for the French fashion house isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. With the styling assistance of her ex-husband Kanye West, Kardashian used SNL to highlight Balenciaga\u2019s distinctive silhouettes. On her way to the studio, Kardashian wore a long, pink anorak coat by Balenciaga\u2014an ode to the technical, sporty pieces that Demna Gvasalia often designs. She paired it with silver pointy boots, a glittery handbag, chunky shades, and large dangly earrings for a touch of glam (that juxtaposition between the sporty and glam is a Balenciaga signature, after all). After performing her monologue in the sexier, more form-fitting catsuit,\u00a0Kardashian went on to wear some non-Balenciaga costumes throughout the show to play\u00a0Aladdin\u2019s Jasmine\u00a0and\u00a0The Bachelorette. Kardashian left the SNL studio wearing yet another Balenciaga look. This time, it was a spandex catsuit with built-in heels, paired with a shaggy floor-length coat for a slight disco feel. The large crystal earrings also returned, presumedly ready for an after-party with the whole cast. It\u2019s no wonder Kardashian brought BBE\u2014big Balenciaga energy\u2014to the SNL stage this weekend: she\u2019s been wearing the label almost exclusively lately. This year, she\u2019s worn it on the red carpet (remember her Met Gala look?), on the streets, and even as part of Kanye West\u2019s concert (where they recreated their wedding vows\u2014in Balenciaga Haute Couture, no less). As a muse of the house, Kim and Balenciaga are clearly a match made in heaven.",

This summer, they introduced their latest EP, Queendom, to the world\u2014their first release since Sappy EP in 2019 year. The danceable genre-bending extended play earned the group their first spot on the Billboard Global 200. Throughout the promotional cycle, members Irene, Yeri, Joy, Wendy, and Seulgi wore striking outfits from brands like Gucci, Celine, Prada, and Loewe, making them one of the most stylish bands around. In the music videos, the girls went on an archival deep dive, revisiting seven years of outfits from their past work. Presented on social media as part of their \u201cQueens Mystic General Store,\u201d the rewind delighted their superfans, the \u201cReveluvs.\u201d Of course, the group\u2019s fashion relevance extends beyond their devotees. With Joy recently named as the ambassador for Italian luxury fixture Tod\u2019s, Seulgi tapped to represent Salvatore Ferragamo, and Irene the face of Prada since 2020, they maintain an outsized influence on the world of luxury. Below, the group talks about the meaning behind their new music and how their style has evolved since their early days. How do you define the concept of \u201cQueendom?\u201d WENDY: Queendom contains a message about how we are all \u201cqueens\u201d of our own lives, and that we shine more beautifully when we are all together. It\u2019s been a while since we came out with new music, so we put a lot of thought into expressing and showcasing Red Velvet\u2019s unique colors differently. So, we came up with this creative idea of storytelling through 3 different concepts, \u2018Homecoming\u2019, \u2018Journey\u2019, and \u2018Carnival.\u2019 When you listen to our song, you can also feel our bright and positive energy! How was the process of making the Queendom album different from your previous outings? IRENE: With this particular album, all the members worked extra hard to deliver their best. We were extra focused throughout the entire process, from recording the songs to perfecting the choreography. We paid attention to every little detail in order to come back as a stronger artist and showcase our unique charms as Red Velvet. Red Velvet represents two sides, Red being more pop-focused and Velvet delving into R&B. How does the album represent the Red side of things?",

But now, the best fall hats for women are on deck for cooler weather, from cashmere beanies to leather berets and wool wide-brims. Yes, the woven straw fedoras, cotton caps, and visors of summer and holiday getaways hold a special place in our hearts. But with autumn\u2019s crisp breeze and desire for all things cozy, fall hats are among the few finishing touches that instantly take an outfit from great to outstanding. Even if you don\u2019t consider yourself a hat person, there\u2019s undoubtedly a style that might appeal to you. For classic tastes, the wool or felt wide-brim is fail-safe when it comes to statement-making style, whether you\u2019re drawn to a rancher, tall triangle crown, or garden hat. The fedora is a close cousin, with a slightly shorter rim\u2014flawless for day-to-day wear in deliciously rich earthy tones and neutrals. If your excitement for trendy bucket hats and baseball caps has not yet waned, there are corduroy, and velvet iterations with your name on them come fall. Each one is decidedly fitting for the cooler weather while adding a textural element to layered outfits of all kinds. Speaking of texture, oh-so-cozy boucl\u00e9 and shearling, as well as sleek leather, is prominent on the fall hat scene. From beanies to buckets and berets to baker-boys, you can find just about every silhouette covered in these tactile fabrics. And for those who favor beanies and berets, there\u2019s no shortage of those in luxurious cashmere, warm wool, or cotton crochet. Ready to stock up on stylish fall hats? Scroll on to discover 36 of the best fall hats for women guaranteed to make a statement. Whether black, ivory, rust, or sage speaks to you, a wide-brim hat in wool or felt is quintessentially fall and no longer exclusive to mountain or southwestern getaways. Lean in to nostalgia by way of the bucket hat for fall in luxe textures like corduroy, wool, or boucl\u00e9. Of course, Prada\u2019s iconic nylon can\u2019t be beaten for a \u201990s style moment. You can easily transition the baseball cap to fall by opting for rich textures like corduroy, wool, or leather instead of standard cotton or twill. The beanie is a cold-weather classic\u2014upgrade your assortment with cashmere fabrications, bolder striped and neon iterations, or a seasonal tone like a rich orange-brown. The fedora is forever, particularly fall\u2019s versions made from wool or felt. If you\u2019ve already got a black one in your collection, a rich brown, olive, tan, or gray is a logical new addition. You\u2019ve no doubt spotted fall\u2019s surge of shearing and boucl\u00e9 accessories, from bags to footwear, and hats are, indeed, part of the trend. Choose the Row\u2019s subtle beanie for a timeless look, or go bolder in Gabriela Hearst\u2019s cult alpaca-blend cap. Look no further than the leather hat for a sleek textural statement, whether in a beret, bucket, or baseball cap shape. The baker-boy or newsboy hat comes with a throwback feel\u2014the silhouette dates back to the 1910s. Go classic with a navy or black version made from felt or wool, or modernize the effect with a pearl-adorned or woven leather version. Channel your inner French woman with a timeless beret. A crocheted or minimal hot pink design will stand out from the crowd, while classic white or black wool never fails.",

  "body": "To celebrate his 10th anniversary as creative director of the house of Balmain last month, Olivier Rousteing staged the kind of spectacle only a designer with his audacious vision could pull off. Featuring 6,000 attendees, a performance from Doja Cat, runway walks from the likes of Naomi Campbell and Carla Bruni, and a voiceover celebrating his work courtesy of Beyonc\u00e9, it capped Rousteing\u2019s decade at the house with all the brilliant bombast that has become his unmistakable signature. But there was another reason for this celebratory spirit, too, as he revealed to reporters following the show. In October of last year, Rousteing suffered severe burns after a fireplace at his home exploded, which he explained came to inform the collection with its notable sense of ease and comfort. And today, Rousteing opened up about his ordeal publicly for the first time, posting an image of himself to Instagram that was taken soon after leaving hospital, with his upper body almost entirely bandaged to aid his recovery. \u201cI finally feel ready to share this,\u201d wrote Rousteing. \u201cI\u2019ve been hiding this for too long and it\u2019s time for you to know.\u201d As well as sharing details of the experience itself, he paid a heartfelt tribute to the medical staff who helped him on his journey back to recovery. \u201cI woke up the next morning in Paris\u2019s H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe talented staff at that famous hospital, which was dealing with an incredible number of Covid cases at that same time, took amazing care of me. I cannot thank them enough.\u201d View on Instagram Just as impressive as Rousteing\u2019s rapid recovery is the fact he continued to produce collections all throughout the past year, with many of his shows being celebrated for their innovative approach to reworking the runway format while dealing with the restrictions imposed by Covid-19. One such example was his spring 2021 show, where the usual front-row crowd was present on digital screens, in an ingenious melding of the conventional fashion show with the key role technology played in keeping that sense of community alive throughout the pandemic. At his most recent show, he noted that throughout his recovery he had used turtlenecks, face masks, long sleeves, and jewelry to conceal the effects of the fire. But in his Instagram post today, Rousteing remarked that he felt ready to turn over a new leaf and opened up about his efforts to recast this devastating event as something positive\u2014in no small part through the beauty of the clothes he\u2019s created over the past year while recovering. \u201cMy last show was about the celebration of healing over pain and I thank all the models, the productions, my team, the models, my Balmain family, [and] my friends that came and supported not only my 10 years of Balmain, but my rebirth,\u201d he wrote. Ultimately, the message Rousteing hoped to share was an inspiring one: of self-love, gratitude, and the healing power of creativity. \u201cToday, I feel so free, so good and so lucky,\u201d wrote Rousteing. \u201cI\u2019m beginning a new chapter with a smile on my face and a heart full of gratitude.\u201d",

Last week, she opted for the designer\u2019s fully studded jacket with dangerous spikes sticking out of the shoulders, while this week, she closed Paris Fashion week out with a radiant green bodysuit and high-waisted trouser look yet again by Quinn. She topped it off with a pair of matching green Bottega Veneta sunglasses. Another person having a stellar time during fashion month was Nina Kraviz. The Russian dentist-turned-DJ showed off a delicious color-blocked mod dress along with some knee-high white leather boots by the Paris-based label Abra. Another standout look this past week was from Rickey Thompson. The comedian-actor-influencer truly can pull off any outfit, even if it includes the barely-there threads of Ludovic de Saint Sernin. He opted for a gloriously beaded halter top that came in a plaid print. His caption said it all: \u201cLudovic stays on MY BODY\u201d. Stateside, there was Fran Drescher looking as radiant as ever in two body-skimming dresses as she was filming the show Gravesend. We have a feeling that Nanny Fine would approve both looks. Also filming was Jonah Hill, who has been showing off his bold print collection of camp shirts lately. This time around, he opted for a salmon pink iteration with green dogs printed on it. Cute! Finally, Dua Lipa showed off some princess-y kicks that we are obsessed with. The pair were by Y-Project and came with a flower embellishment. The perfect way to step into the season.

In addition to the Yetti boots at Miu Miu and the shearling-lined trapper hats at Dior, there was also a plethora of puffball bags and shearling swaddled shoes. And while snuggly hiking boots and faux fur totes would certainly fit the bill for a snow-filled forecast, Soraya Zaman\u2019s shoot of the most striking shearling pieces (set within Colorado\u2019s romantically rocky terrain) suggests otherwise. For fall-winter 2021, shearling\u2019s the norm\u2014no matter your locale. Take Marni\u2019s fuzz-covered pumps for a day in the office or Fendi\u2019s pink-dyed clutch to a winter soiree. Or, pair Stuart Weitzman\u2019s shearling lace-ups with summer frocks for a soft take on transitional fall dressing.

But the franchise\u2019s real standout fashion moments have always come courtesy of the Bond girls, the sidekicks (and sometimes adversaries) of Bond whose prowess in a fight to the death is matched only by their sartorial flair. And as the role of the Bond girl, or Bond woman, has evolved over the years, so has her style. While the actors of yesteryear were more likely to be found in bikinis or negligees, today they\u2019re as often sporting a killer suit as a couture gown. Here, we round up all the best onscreen fashion moments from Bond movies across seven decades\u2014all the way up to the latest film, No Time to Die. While Quantum of Solace is often (and perhaps unfairly) maligned as the weakest film of the franchise\u2019s Daniel Craig era, it didn\u2019t disappoint in the style stakes. That\u2019s in no small part thanks to Olga Kurylenko\u2019s showstopping turn as Camille Montes, a woman seeking revenge against the film\u2019s villain for the murder of her family. As one of the tougher Bond girls in recent memory, it only felt right that she should wear a look by Prada; that the black cocktail dress with a sweetheart neckline and wide shoulder straps should be effortlessly stylish too was simply the cherry on the cake.",

In this episode of Good Morning Vogue, Anna Wintour and Hamish Bowles are joined by Sofia Coppola, Inez van Lamsweerde, Vinoodh Matadin, and others as they decode some of the house codes, as set forth by the founder, Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel; Karl Lagerfeld; and current creative director Virginie Viard, who expresses her preference for simplicity and joins in the fun. \u201cChanel is its own world,\u201d notes Van Lamsweerde, and it was one that reflected the exquisite taste of the founder, who, as her own best model, was the face of the brand. Having started as a milliner, Chanel transformed fashion in the 1920s by introducing simple dresses and jackets in jersey (a then unheard-of fabric for luxury fashion) that a woman could live, love, dine, and dance in. When Chanel reopened her house in 1953, having shuttered it during the war, her tweed cardigan suits with passementerie trim and chain-weighted hems once again became a uniform of the chic. Lagerfeld, who took charge of the brand in 1983, proved that the house could stand, and flourish, in the (physical) absence of its founder. \u201cKarl,\u201d says his close friend and Vogue\u2019s global editorial director Anna Wintour, \u201cwas superman.\u201d\u00a0Having absorbed the house codes, Lagerfeld gave them a postmodern makeover, adding elements from the street as well as his captivating sense of humor. It was such an exciting and powerful mix that Lagerfeld\u2019s legacy equals that of Coco\u2019s. Chanel is now in the capable hands of Viard, who worked side by side with Lagerfeld for years. Without discarding all that came before, she is quietly asserting her own signature, a combination of soft femininity and rock-and-roll edge. And as Bowles notes, with Viard at the helm, the house is once again led by a woman designing for other women.\u00a0Vive la femme!

Those of us who love style\u2014not just fashion\u2014might have picked up on the haphazard, thrown-together sensibility outside the shows in Milan and Paris; the embrace of odd layering and dresses-over-pants in London and New York; and, in every city, a marked evolution in \u201cgender fluid\u201d style, to the point where it\u2019s no longer novel to see people of every identity in skirts or heels. It\u2019s all just clothes! The shift to more creative, authentic style was in motion throughout the pandemic, but as Fashion Week snapped back to the chaos of the Before Times, it was fair to assume the street style scene would resume its excesses, too. There were still plenty of branded looks and over-curated ensembles, but it was the eclectic, highly personal outfits that felt relevant to our times. To this viewer, the big themes\u2014clashing prints, vivid color-blocking, strange layers, tailored vests\u2014reflected our year at home, surrounded by our stuff and a desire to get more use out of it all. Why accumulate more clothes when you can find new ways to mix up your favorite things and revisit the items you\u2019d forgotten about? (In case you weren\u2019t aware of the link between overconsumption and climate change, Extinction Rebellion staged a protest to spell it out: overconsumption = extinction). Below, we\u2019ve distilled eight of the season\u2019s most pervasive and surprising street style trends. If you\u2019re craving more inspo, come back for our coverage of Shanghai and Taipei street style in the coming days. Conventional wisdom has it that we should choose one print, then balance it with quiet neutrals and solids. Many show-goers took the opposite tack: wearing all of their brightest, boldest, most beloved prints at once. It reads like equal parts defiance and exuberance\u2014shirking the rules and piling on your happiest, most joy-sparking garments.",

In the Before Times, we posted the numbers every season, but during the pandemic the runway system was too disrupted, with some brands showing after the official season (Gucci) and others moving to a pre-season cycle (Marc Jacobs), to do it. Now, in the spirit of establishing a new normal, we\u2019re bringing it back. The picture this spring 2022 ranking paints is of a shifting industry. Some key players\u2014Celine and Bottega Veneta, in addition to the aforementioned names\u2014are still weeks or months away from presenting their new collections, in-person or via video. Had they re-entered the fray, they\u2019re likely to have made the list. Their absence, then, has left room for new names. The highest new ranking is Givenchy in position 6. After a couple of quiet, COVID-time seasons, it was Matthew Williams\u2019s runway debut, and there\u2019s a lot of curiosity about this friend of Lady Gaga, school of Virgil Abloh designer, especially after he dressed Kendall Jenner so sensationally in a spangled naked dress at the Met Gala last month. More interesting to us, though, is the appearance of Maryam Nassir Zadeh, a newcomer to this list, if not to the New York fashion scene. Nassir Zadeh opened her store in the Lower East Side back in 2008, and in the years since what my colleague Emily Farra describes as her \u201cmodern vision of femininity rooted in individuality and curiosity\u201d has come to define downtown cool.

(It was as a direct result of reading about Lee\u2019s food life that I discovered my absolute favorite family-style Thai place in Brooklyn, but I digress.) Onscreen, Lee is the best friend you wish you had, full of verve and never without a witty comeback; plus, her characters tend to be united by a keen eye for fashion. These days, Lee can be found playing the ambitious, Gen-Z-literate former media-company president Stella Bak on The Morning Show, which returned for its second season last month. Vogue recently spoke with Lee about the series, her avoiding social media in her own life, and Stella\u2019s inimitable style. Read the full interview below. Vogue: What originally drew you to the character of Stella? Greta Lee: At the time that I read the script, I happen to be fully immersed in books like Trick Mirror by Jia Tolentino and Uncanny Valley by Anna Wiener, and I was obsessed with Elizabeth Holmes, just like everyone else. I happened to be in this place where I was absorbing a lot of material about the record number of young people in leadership positions, and the record number of women and people of color coming in to try and implement real change in the workplace. I was watching my peers navigate the corporate world, which is very different than mine, obviously, and then this role came along. When I read the description for Stella Bak, the first and only female news president in UBA history, I just thought, \u201cOh, my God. If this is anything like what I hope it could be like, it could be really great.\u201d I wanted to step up to the challenge. Do you relate to Stella\u2019s desire to appeal to the younger millennial or Gen-Z world? Well, I made it clear to the creatives on The Morning Show that, though I am technically a millennial, I\u2019m much more analog in my identity. I\u2019m not on social media.

The start and the finish will linger in our memories. Collina Strada for its come-one-come-all casting and exuberant messaging about sustainability. And the Alber Elbaz tribute, \u201cLove Brings Love,\u201d for its strong sense of community spirit. Rick Owens, Jean Paul Gaultier, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Anthony Vaccarello, Pierpaolo Piccioli, and Olivier Rousteing all made looks in Alber\u2019s honor and sat side-by-side in the AZ Factory front row. In between, Vogue Runway\u2019s reporters tallied up nearly 150 spring 2022 reviews of IRL shows. How does a designer stand out in that mix? What makes a show connect? Great clothes are essential, but those you can find off the catwalk in appointments, presentations, and even Zoom calls, which, of course, there were no shortage of either.",

  "body": "If the plot twists and turns of the Netflix hit *Squid Game* had you hanging by the edge of your seat, you aren\u2019t alone. Since its debut in September, the series has moved from hit to cultural phenomenon, quickly becoming the most streamed original program ever to grace the platform. Fast-paced and gore filled, the nine episodes created by writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk kept everyone guessing until the very end\u2014even the cast. For Hoyeon Jung\u2014who plays secretive pickpocket Kang Sae-byeok, a.k.a. Competitor 067\u2014the mystery began during auditions. \u201cI only received three parts of the script before the audition,\u201d she shared via email from Seoul. \u201cThey contained the scenes with Sae-byeok\u2019s younger brother, the broker dealing with North Korea, and the conversation with Gi-Hun in the second-to-last episode. I didn\u2019t have much context; I had to use my imagination to fill in the blanks.\u201d Fleshing out a character as complex as Sae-byeok would be a challenge for a seasoned performer, but Squid Game was Jung\u2019s acting debut. Already a familiar face in the world of fashion, the 27-year-old has modeled for brands like Chanel, Bottega Veneta, and Louis Vuitton, which named her its latest global ambassador earlier today. Most models are discovered by someone else, but Jung made her way into the industry by sheer force of will. Originally from Myeonmok-dong, a suburb of Seoul, she worked freelance at Seoul Fashion Week as a teenager, getting cast in shows without help from an agency. Within six years, she\u2019d found representation on her own, placed second in the fourth season of Korea\u2019s Next Top Model, and landed on the cover of Vogue\u2019s Korean edition. During this time, Jung became a film buff. Constantly on the road for modeling, she\u2019d marathon movies as an off-duty escape, watching favorites like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Fargo,\u00a0and Kill Bill repeatedly.\u00a0\u00a0Ironically Jung preferred art-house cinema to thrillers and gore. \u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of horror movies, but I like a few within the genre,\u201d she says, nodding to artsier fare like Ari Aster\u2019s 2019 hit, Midsommar, or Jim Jarmusch\u2019s zombie satire, The Dead Don\u2019t Die. A fan of performers who disappear into their work like Frances McDormand, Doona Bae, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, and Adam Driver, Jung\u2019s interest in acting stemmed from a broader desire to understand herself and others better. \u201cWhen I\u2019d travel by myself on airplanes and stay at hotels, I spent most of my days just watching movies,\u201d she says. \u201c[Afterward] I thought more and more about myself and my position in humanity at large. Who was I? What does it mean to be human? The need to answer those questions was what brought me to acting.\u201d As Squid Game was her very first audition, Jung didn\u2019t anticipate landing a part or that the series would become wildly popular. \u201cI was just so happy that I got a role and could give a performance,\u201d she says. \u201cI still feel nervous at the thought of meeting an audience through the screen. I never dreamed that the show would become such a global sensation.\u201d Still, she has a theory on why it has captivated viewers. \u201cSquid Game is a story about human nature that most people can already relate to, yet everything is communicated through easy-to-follow childhood games,\u201d says Jung, who found the \u201cbizarre irony\u201d of the competitors\u2019 real-world lives and their in-game personas especially compelling. \u201cThe stories created by the various characters resonated with me,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir personalities fueled the choices that they made and their consequences.\u201d",

I know: I\u2019ve been trying since speaking to the actress and musician earlier this autumn. Gainsbourg was born into good taste and in her 50 years has inspired legions to try to capture the authenticity, the freedom, and the self-assuredness of her look. But rather than reflect on all the elements of Gainsbourg\u2019s style, from Balenciaga and Saint Laurent minidresses to her red carpet suits, she tells me there is one item so essential to her taste she could not imagine living without it: jeans. And as the daughter of two denim-loving icons\u2014Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg\u2014she\u2019s been wearing good jeans since day one. Photo: Courtesy of Zara \u201cOf course my mother bought me jeans, OshKosh and all of that when that was a trend in the \u201970s,\u201d Gainsbourg said over Zoom from Paris. \u201cBut I\u2019m always looking for the best pair of jeans\u2014I\u2019ve been looking all my life!\u201d Her lifelong affinity for denim has led her to partner with Zara on a concise collection of denim and other essentials that capture the essence of Charlotte Gainsbourg as she sees it during the tail end of 2021.

First up, his collaboration with the eyewear company Arnette, which releases today.

The streamlined \u201cGullwing\u201d shades for instance\u2014designed in a clear, rectangular shape\u2014take cues from the Mercedes-Benz vehicle of the same name, while the round, pink \u201cDrophead\u201d shades reference the bold Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe.

  "body": "Without a doubt, one of the standout shows of New York Fashion Week was Rodarte\u2019s spring 2022 show. The final look, a lilac dress with a built in cape speckled with mushroom illustrations, is still making rounds on social media. \u201cWhen we were talking about the show and the inspiration, we were thinking it was all about the individual experience, communal experience, and artistic experience,\u201d says Laura Mulleavy, who co-designs Rodarte with her sister Kate, in Vogue\u2019s latest video. One of the first models they thought of to bring this vision to life was Ruby Aldridge. So who better to take Vogue along for a day in the life prepping for the show? Aldridge is a veteran model at this point. The 30 year old started modeling in her teens, in part because her sister, Lily, was already in the industry. \u201cShe was doing a photoshoot for Elle Girl magazine,\u201d Aldridge explains. \u201cOne of the girls had dropped out that morning or maybe the night before. I was maybe 14, and her agency was just like, \u2018why don\u2019t you use her little sister?\u2019\u201d Quickly, Aldridge\u2019s star began to rise. For her first season walking the runways, she opened Marc by Marc Jacobs and also walked in his eponymous label\u2019s show. \u201cI don\u2019t even know that I would have the stamina [now] to do what I did 10 or however many years ago, show wise,\u201d she says. Before heading to Rodarte\u2019s venue at 55 Bethune Street to get hair and makeup done, Aldridge started her day with a leisurely skincare routine and some instant coffee. Her pre-show look is a standout on its own: a cow print corset and trouser set that prompts a stranger on the street to yell out \u201cnice outfit.\u201d (Aldridge takes it in stride). On her way, she stops by a deli to get a smoothie and, of course, strut through the aisles. Gotta practice! Her hair and makeup for the show is clean and minimal: fresh face and stick-straight hair. Other models are wearing sun ray-inspired face paint, which Aldridge admits she\u2019s a little jealous of. Then it\u2019s time for rehearsal, and for Aldridge to swap out her Hello Kitty band-aid for something more show-appropriate. \u201cBlisters are simply part of the experience,\u201d she says. As the models rehearse the show, Aldridge offers her tips and tricks to the camera. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta think of something positive and be confident, or else you\u2019ll look like a lost puppy,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t take yourself too seriously, and don\u2019t fall. Just don\u2019t fall.\u201d Before the show, she gives herself a pep-talk that riffs on the same ideas. \u201cRight before I walk out I just tell myself positive things in my head,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to fall. You\u2019re going to be great.\u201d And she was. Watch her day at the Rodarte show below.

Where else can you wear a puffer jacket plus sandals or a trench coat with a miniskirt on the same day, let alone the same outfit? And for the past eight days, Paris Fashion Week showgoers have been doing just that. A common outfit formula seen around the bustling Paris streets included short hemlines, long overcoats, and sturdy flat boots\u2014three of fall\u2019s must-have items in one foolproof look. Taking a closer look at Paris Fashion Week street style stars gives us a lesson in how to mix fall\u2019s fabulous miniskirts with the season\u2019s selection of classic coats and knee-high boots. Keep in mind it\u2019s helpful to have your coat and boots meet or overlap to ensure there\u2019s no awkward leg gap exposed. Leave the rest of the mix up to your imagination. Go long\\ (and short!) this fall with these six styling ideas below. Pile on the prints, and if you get cold, you can always add a pair of tights too. Sporty sunglasses and leather trench coats would normally give off a Matrix aesthetic, but when paired with cowboy boots and brown leathers, the look feels 2021. This fall and winter reach for a sleek, ankle-length, double-breasted menswear-inspired coat for any and all of your outfits\u2014miniskirts and combat boots included. Add a little giddyup to a mod mini and grandpa-inspired sweater vest\u2014and don\u2019t forget a leather trench. Paired with an otherwise all-black ensemble of a cozy cardigan and wooly blanket coat, a pop-star-worthy micro-mini adds a surprising element of color. A tricolor brown-toned leather jacket works surprisingly well with a chunky gray knit and black knee-high riding boots.",

But others endure for so long they become part of the fashion landscape, seemingly forever\u2014like, say, those on Louis Vuitton handbags. One hundred and twenty-five years ago, Georges Vuitton, who had inherited the famed luggage maison from his father, Louis, faced a dilemma: how to distinguish his house\u2019s elegant goods from the many other luxury travel companies vying for a wealthy Parisian clientele. He was desperate that the brand\u2019s innovations\u2014among them the introduction of a trunk with a flat top that could be stacked, replacing the old-fashioned dome covers\u2014not be purloined by imitators. So Georges came up with the famous logo that we know so well: that V overlapping the L, in tawny gold over saddle brown. To make this monogram even more distinctive, he added two more elements: a stylized flower with four pointed petals inside a black rhombus, and a rounded flower within a solid circle.",

Ziwe possesses a straight-shooter sensibility that will slice and dice anyone she interviews. And her love for buoyant fashion is just as head-turning and sharp as her humor. Think: larger-than-life hats, big boas, bright colors, and references to Clueless and Moesha. Her style has gotten her noticed by luxury houses like Valentino, which invited her to attend its spring 2022 show in Paris. \u201cNot to quote the famous film Passport to Paris with Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, but I\u2019ve never felt more French,\u201d Ziwe tells Vogue. \u201cI could see the Eiffel Tower from my hotel room.\u201d Over the next few days, she took in all that the city had to offer during Paris Fashion Week, whether that was ordering a truckload of cheesy omelets, having drinks at The Ritz, or watching the Valentino show. \u201cThe trip was unbelievable from start to finish. I felt like Carrie Bradshaw, but not sad, in Paris,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was so wild to see people in person expressing themselves through their clothes, and me going outdoors and expressing myself.\u201d She also met some familiar faces, including Demi Moore (\u201cthe sweetest, loveliest woman to meet\u201d) and Naomi Campbell. \u201cIt\u2019s me and Emily [Ratajkowski] yo-yo-gabbing, and this woman approaches Emily with a mask on and Emily introduces me: \u2018Hey Naomi, this is Ziwe,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI would say it was like a devout Catholic meeting the pope.\u201d Ziwe\u2019s funky and fabulous Valentino look suited her to the core. She wore a loose purple dress, which she describes as \u201cfrockish,\u201d and a pair of sky-high platform white heels\u2014\u201cout of Clueless\u201d\u2014along with a jeweled pink bag. As she watched the show, she was drawn to another purple dress that came down the runway: look 91, adorned with a fluttering cape. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018Okay, do I need to find a lover? Do I need to get engaged? How do I expedite marriage so I can wear this dress at a wedding?\u201d says Ziwe. \u201cIt was so gorgeous that I wanted to wear it now.\u201d",
