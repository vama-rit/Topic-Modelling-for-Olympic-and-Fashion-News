USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland announced all staff, athletes and facility workers are required to get their shots by Nov. 1 if they haven't already, in preparation for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. USOPC personnel must show proof of vaccination by Dec. 1, but exemptions will be awarded in certain medical and religious circumstances. Hirshland said the vaccination requirement will continue into every Olympic and Paralympic event going forward. No other American sports league has a COVID-19 vaccination mandate, although the NHL -- which will begin sending players to the Olympics ahead of Beijing 2022 -- enacted strict protocols such as allowing teams to suspend unvaccinated players if they miss time. The New York Islanders illustrated how serious the league is taking COVID-19 by banning an unvaccinated minor-leaguer from playing for the team. The International Olympic Committee along with most other national Olympic committees -- including the USOPC -- recommended but didn't require athletes participating in the 2020 Tokyo Games to get vaccinated. Still, the USOPC said 83% of its athletes were vaccinated while the IOC estimated 85% overall had their shots. \"The stark reality is that this pandemic is far from over,\" Hirshland wrote in a letter obtained by the Associated Press. \"This step will increase our ability to create a safe and productive environment for Team USA athletes and staff, and allow us to restore consistency in planning, preparation and service to athletes.\" Team USA plans to send nearly 240 athletes to the 2022 Winter Olympics, which are scheduled to start Feb. 4 and will likely have testing and social-distancing requirements akin to the ones Tokyo implemented for the Summer Games.", "list": null, "preprocessed": "u.s olympic paralympic committee take strong stance covid-19 vaccine many american sports league wednesday usopc ceo sarah hirshland announce staff athlete facility worker require get shot nov 1 already preparation 2022 beijing winter olympics usopc personnel must show proof vaccination dec 1 exemption award certain medical religious circumstance hirshland say vaccination requirement continue every olympic paralympic event go forward american sport league covid-19 vaccination mandate although nhl begin send player olympic ahead beijing 2022 enact strict protocol allow team suspend unvaccinated player miss time new york islander illustrate serious league take covid-19 ban unvaccinated minor leaguer play team international olympic committee along national olympic committee include usopc recommend require athlete participate 2020 tokyo game get vaccinate still usopc say 83 athlete vaccinate ioc estimate 85 overall shot stark reality pandemic far hirshland write letter obtain associated press step increase ability create safe productive environment team usa athlete staff allow we restore consistency planning preparation service athlete team usa plan send nearly 240 athlete 2022 winter olympic schedule start feb 4 likely testing social distance requirement akin one tokyo implement summer game"}, {"link": "https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/katie-ledecky-to-serve-as-volunteer-swimming-coach-at-florida-while-training-for-2024-olympics-in-gainesville/", "title": "Katie Ledecky to serve as volunteer swimming coach at Florida while training for 2024 Olympics in Gainesville", "subtitle": "The seven-time Olympic gold medalist and eight-time NCAA champion brings a wealth of experience to the Gators' program", "author": "Wajih AlBaroudi", "date": "9/22/2021", "time": "19:40", "section": null, "body": "One of the most decorated swimmers in Olympic history is headed for new waters: the Swamp. Katie Ledecky, a 10-time Olympic medalist with seven golds, announced Wednesday she'll serve as a volunteer swimming coach at the University of Florida while training for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Gainesville. At Florida the 24-year-old Ledecky will reunite with Gators swimming coach Anthony Nesty, who served on Team USA's staff during the Tokyo Games. \"The knowledge and experience that Katie brings to the pool are unparalleled,\" Nesty said in a statement. \"In addition to her obvious excellence as a swimmer, Katie is an exceptional person who will make a great impact on the student-athletes here. Katie's values are in total alignment with the Florida program, and we're so excited to have her join the Gators as she continues to train for the 2024 Olympics.\" Ledecky, who earned her bachelor's degree in psychology from Stanford during June's Olympic Trials, brings a wealth of college experience and success to the Gators' staff. In only two years of collegiate swimming Ledecky won eight individual NCAA championships and powered the Cardinal to consecutive NCAA and Pac-12 titles from 2017-18. The three-time Olympian has dominated the international stage as much as college, winning the most medals of any female Team USA athlete in her last two appearances at the Games. Ledecky's seven gold medals in Olympic individual events are the most ever by a female Team USA athlete. \"I'm excited to be a part of the University of Florida's world-class swimming and diving program and train for the 2024 Olympics with Coach Anthony Nesty, and the top-tier mid-distance and distance training group,\" said Ledecky, who also cited Gainesville's proximity to her home in Maryland as a reason for the move. \"My years at Stanford, both academically and athletically, were nothing short of incredible and I'm looking forward to the opportunity and challenges that lie ahead in Gainesville.\" Ledecky has spent the last five years training at her alma mater under Team USA coach Greg Meehan. She'll now work with a 1988 Olympic gold medalist in Nesty and fellow Olympic medalists Bobby Finke and Kieran Smith, and she's amped for the challenge to compete with the men. \"I think I always benefit from training with the guys,\" Ledecky told USA Today, \"so I'll be able to do that very consistently down in Florida with athletes who have similar goals that I do to compete on the international level in those events. They have a very deep group of male distance and mid-distance swimmers and I'm really excited about that.\" Ledecky won't be the only Olympic superstar in Florida's pool.

According to a recent report published by the Department of Justice's inspector general, FBI agents didn't act with \"seriousness and urgency\" regarding reports of Nassar and his misconducts. The report found that FBI agents mishandled evidence and even made false statements to investigators relating to the case. \"It truly feels like the FBI turned a blind eye to us,\" Biles told the Senate on Wednesday. She added that the FBI agents in question need to be prosecuted and held fully accountable for their lack of action. Biles also questioned why the Department of Justice hasn't already handed out criminal charges to these FBI agents. During Wednesday's hearing, senators stated that a Justice Department official declined to speak regarding the investigation. Raisman informed the senators that it took 14 months for FBI agents to speak to her after the initial report of Nassar's sexual misconduct in 2015. That means that for more than a year after the initial report, Nassar was permitted to see patients. Dozens of young women were sexually assaulted during that time period. \"Why would duly sworn officers ignore reports of abuse across state lines?\" Raisman asked on Wednesday. Fellow American gymnast McKayla Maroney, like Raisman, brought up the timeline. \"By not taking action from my report they (the FBI) allowed a child molester to go free for more than a year. They had legal evidence of child abuse and did nothing,\" Maroney stated in her testimony. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz and FBI Director Christopher Wray also testified on Wednesday. Wray did acknowledge that the FBI agents were in the wrong and said that there were \"fundamental errors that occurred in 2015 and 2016 that should never have happened.\" Wray informed the senators that the FBI was altering its processes in order to make sure that a failure of this magnitude never happens again. When the first complaints were brought to the FBI's attention in 2015, Wray wasn't leading the FBI at that time. \"I'm deeply and profoundly sorry,\" Wray said \"...I'm especially sorry that there were people at the FBI who had their own chance to stop this monster in 2015 and failed. It never should have happened. And we're doing everything in our power to make sure it never happens again.\" Nassar is currently serving a 60-year prison sentence for child pornography charges, which is from police finding that material on his property in September 2016. In addition, Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in Michigan state court. That added 175 years to his prison sentence.", "list": null, "preprocessed": "united states olympic gymnasts simone bile aly raisman hand wednesday tell senate judiciary committee fbi agent need hold accountable mishandle investigation former team usa doctor larry nassar accord recent report publish department justice inspector general fbi agent act seriousness urgency regard report nassar misconduct report find fbi agent mishandle evidence even make false statement investigator relate case truly feel like fbi turn blind eye we bile tell senate wednesday add fbi agent question need prosecute hold fully accountable lack action bile also question department justice already hand criminal charge fbi agent wednesday hearing senator state justice department official decline speak regard investigation raisman inform senator take 14 month fbi agent speak initial report nassar sexual misconduct 2015 mean year initial report nassar permit see patient dozen young woman sexually assault time period would duly swear officer ignore report abuse across state line raisman ask wednesday fellow american gymnast mckayla maroney like raisman bring timeline take action report fbi allow child molester go free year legal evidence child abuse nothing maroney state testimony justice department inspector general michael horowitz fbi director christopher wray also testify wednesday wray acknowledge fbi agent wrong say fundamental error occur 2015 2016 never happen wray inform senator fbi alter process order make sure failure magnitude never happen first complaint bring fbi attention 2015 wray lead fbi time deeply profoundly sorry wray say especially sorry people fbi chance stop monster 2015 fail never happen everything power make sure never happen nassar currently serve 60 year prison sentence child pornography charge police find material property september 2016 addition nassar plead guilty 10 count first degree criminal sexual conduct michigan state court add 175 year prison sentence"}, {"link": "https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/world-anti-doping-agency-reviewing-cannabis-status-as-banned-substance-following-shacarri-richardsons-dq/", "title": "World Anti-Doping Agency reviewing cannabis' status as banned substance following Sha'Carri Richardson's DQ", "subtitle": "The announcement comes two months United States track star Sha'Carri Richardson was disqualified from competing in the Tokyo Olympics", "author": "Chris Bengel", "date": "9/15/2021", "time": "15:06", "section": null, "body": "The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) executive committee announced on Tuesday that it will review the status of cannabis as a banned substance.

In a statement, WADA stated that the agency received many requests from \"a number of stakeholders\" asking to look further into the status of cannabis as a banned substance. This review will take place in 2022 and be conducted by the Prohibited List Expert Advisory Group within WADA. Until then, cannabis will still be banned in competition. The earliest that will change will be in 2022 after the review is over. In 2011, the WADA published a paper that stated that marijuana is banned because cannabis \"could potentially endanger\" athletes \"and others because of increased risk taking, slower reaction times and poor executive function or decision making.\" WADA also believes that cannabis can be \"performance enhancing\" for athletes. However, a 2018 study that was published in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine determined that there \"is no direct evidence of performance-enhancing effects in athletes.\" Richardson used marijuana in Oregon, a state where the substance is legal, after learning about the death of her biological mother.

But while Chelimo calls earning the medal an \"honor,\" the 30-year-old admits the Games were \"very intense\" and \"took a lot out of\" him. Chelimo's exhaustion was evident when he collapsed through the end line to finish just a fraction of a second ahead of Kenya's Nicholas Kipkorir Kimeli. The 40th annual New Balance Fifth Avenue Mile will be Chelimo's biggest step toward returning to form while also preserving his body. Chelimo will compete against 13 Tokyo Olympians, two Olympic medalists and two past event champions in the race slated for Sept. 12 in New York. \"I can't think of any road race in the world bigger than the Fifth Avenue Mile,\" said Chelimo, who'll be competing in first one-mile race since 2018. \"It's going to be on the weekend, it's always live on the TV, it's always in New York City -- and I know a lot of people in New York love running. So, that's where I want to be at this time. It should be fun being a part of it and it's hopefully not the last one. \"The goal is I hope I come back with a win.\" Chelimo has two motivating factors for the race. The first, meeting increasingly-high expectations from his fans and sponsors, has been around since he began running professionally. The second, however, is two years old and has given him a \"different drive.\" That second motivating factor is Arianna Chebet Chelimo, Chelimo's first child. \"When I go out there, I grind because she's got to live a better life,\" Chelimo said. \"She's got to have the best life.\" Chelimo wants his daughter to have the best life largely because his own -- prior to moving from Kenya to the U.S. to run collegiately in 2010 -- was far from it. In the 11 years since Chelimo's nearly 10,000-mile journey from his hometown of Itan, Kenya to the U.S., he's adopted the saying \"go hard or suffer the rest of your life.\" The words are ubiquitous across Chelimo's social media. Chelimo's mother instilled that \"go hard\" way of life into him as a child, and it's helped build him into the two-time Olympic medalist the world knows today. \"You always have to work hard for the best things,\" Chelimo said. \"And me coming to the U.S., it was really life-changing, and that's why I believe in 'go hard or suffer the rest of your life.' The United States is a land of opportunities and this is a place where, if you work really hard, everything is going to fall in place.\" \"I just have to go hard,\" he added. \"That's what I go with. The way I grew up, the only way I could get out of poverty and a tough life is just with my running. Running saved me.\" Running in the U.S. may have saved Chelimo, but he handsomely repaid the favor to his new country. Chelimo enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2014 and served as a water-treatment specialist. He gained U.S. citizenship just ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics for his service. The Army -- including its Word Class Athlete Program, which trains Olympic hopefuls such as Chelimo -- gave him a new mentality. A more respectful, humble, resilient and tough mentality. It's a mentality he carries into every race. \"You got to be resilient, you got to be tough,\" Chelimo said. \"And they teach you that, when you go to war, be ready to die for your country. So, that's the same way I feel when I wear the United States singlet. I feel like I'm representing the military in a different type of way.\" Chelimo's next big goal requires him to represent Team USA again. He's hoping to earn gold -- at age 38 -- in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Belief, Chelimo says, is what he's relying on to reach that goal. Belief has also gotten Chelimo to thrive after moving across the ocean, serving his country, succeeding at the Olympic level and providing for his daughter. As long as Chelimo goes hard, he's confident that trend will continue. \"If I win gold in the United States, in L.A., that's really, really [bigger] than winning gold in any other type of Olympics,\" Chelimo said. \"...That would be a dream come true.\"", "list": null, "preprocessed": "long distance runner paul chelimo become team usa first two time olympic medalist 5,000 meter event last month tokyo chelimo call earn medal honor 30 year old admit game intense take lot chelimo exhaustion evident collapse end line finish fraction second ahead kenya nicholas kipkorir kimeli 40th annual new balance fifth avenue mile chelimo big step toward return form also preserve body chelimo compete 13 tokyo olympian two olympic medalist two past event champion race slate sept 12 new york ca think road race world big fifth avenue mile say chelimo compete first one mile race since 2018 go weekend always live tv always new york city know lot people new york love run want time fun part hopefully last one goal hope come back win chelimo two motivating factor race first meet increasingly high expectation fan sponsor around since begin run professionally second however two year old give different drive second motivating factor arianna chebet chelimo chelimo first child go grind get live well life chelimo say get good life chelimo want daughter good life largely prior move kenya u.s run collegiately 2010 far 11 year since chelimo nearly 10,000 mile journey hometown itan kenya u.s adopt saying go hard suffer rest life word ubiquitous across chelimo social medium chelimo mother instill go hard way life child help build two time olympic medalist world know today always work hard good thing chelimo say come u.s really life change believe go hard suffer rest life united states land opportunity place work really hard everything go fall place go hard add go way grow way could get poverty tough life running run save run u.s may save chelimo handsomely repay favor new country chelimo enlist u.s army 2014 serve water treatment specialist gain u.s citizenship ahead 2016 rio olympics service army include word class athlete program train olympic hopeful chelimo give new mentality respectful humble resilient tough mentality mentality carry every race got resilient got tough chelimo say teach go war ready die country way feel wear united states singlet feel like represent military different type way chelimo next big goal require represent team usa hope earn gold age 38 2028 los angeles olympics belief chelimo say rely reach goal belief also get chelimo thrive move across ocean serve country succeed olympic level provide daughter long chelimo go hard confident trend continue win gold united states l.a really really big win gold type olympic chelimo say would dream come true"}, {"link": "https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/tokyo-paralympics-shot-putter-muhammad-ziyad-zolkeflis-gold-medal-revoked-for-being-late-to-event/", "title": "Tokyo Paralympics: Shot putter Muhammad Ziyad Zolkefli's gold medal revoked for being late to event", "subtitle": "Zolkefi arrived three minutes late to the competition", "author": "Chris Bengel", "date": "9/3/2021", "time": "18:32", "section": null, "body": "Malaysian shot putter Muhammad Ziyad Zolkefli thought that he had won a gold medal in the F20 class event at the 2020 Paralympics.

For British powerlifter Ali Jawad, he had to take some serious extra precautions. Jawad, 32, ended up \"indirectly\" self-isolating for three years,\u00a0the told BBC, in preparation for the Tokyo Paralympics. The athlete has Crohn's disease and was, at one point not long ago, on the brink of death. Because of his immune system being compromised, Jawad decided to self-isolate as he hoped to make the Tokyo Paralympics. \"This is probably the most invested cycle I've ever had in terms of using every ounce of physical, mental and emotional energy just to even qualify,\" Jawad said. \"The last three or four years with my Crohn's and my health, it's been the hardest of my life.\" Just hours before competing at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics, Jawad was sick with flu-like symptoms and assumed it was a run-of-the-mill stomach bug. However, the symptoms got worse when he returned to the United Kingdom after the Games. That's when he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation of the digestive tract that can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. Jawad went on to compete at the London Games in 2012, where he finished fourth, and then won silver at the following Paralympics in Rio. In preparing for the Toyko Games, Jawad has had to be extremely careful because of his Chron's disease. He even said that whether or not the COVID-19 pandemic happened, he would've been forced to isolate as a result of his condition... because he already was. He chose to isolate and make his own food, as well as not see friends and family, as a way to manage Chron's disease before the pandemic started. COVID did add to his isolation time, as the Olympics and Paralympics were postponed for a year in 2020. Jawad said that helped his situation, though. \"I was never going to make it last year and the extra year allowed me to attempt to get fitter,\" Jawad added.

Xueying, who earned gold in trampoline gymnastics during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, posted photos to social media of her medal peeling off on the upper left-hand side. \"Let me clarify this\u2026 I didn't mean to peel the thing off at first, I just discovered that there was a small mark (like pic one) on my medal,\" Xueying wrote on the social-media website Sina Weibo, per the Global Times. \"I thought that it was probably just dirt, so I rubbed it with my finger and found that nothing changed, so then I picked at it and the mark got bigger.\" The Tokyo Olympic Games' Organizing Committee offered a rebuttal to the \"quality\" issue Xueying posed, telling the Global Times the material coming off the gymnast's medal was its protective coating instead of the actual gold plating. This coating is intended to protect the medals from stains and scratches and \"does not affect the quality of the medal itself,\" the Committee added. Medals awarded during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics contained metal from Japanese citizens' recycled electronic devices, an experimental practice comparable to the Jade-inlaid medals from the 2008 Beijing Games. Should Xueying need a replacement medal, she's in luck. The IOC keeps molds of all the Games' medal designs and offers replacements to Olympic winners for a fee. That foresight came in handy earlier this month when Japanese mayor Takashi Kawamura bit into the gold medal of softball pitcher Miu Goto, and -- after receiving over 8,000 complaints -- offered to pay for a replacement The 2020 Tokyo Olympics' medal maker, Japan Mint, told the Global Times it has yet to find any problems with gold-medal peeling.

She was the fourth youngest woman on a veteran-laden squad. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics, however, presented a new challenge to King: leadership. Because the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the Games a year, a new wave of U.S. swimmers entered the Olympic fray. The result: King could no longer get by as the self-described \"kid.\" \"I went from being the rookie to the vet so quickly,\" said King, who's older than 19 of her 26 Tokyo teammates. \"But in terms of my own success, it was again just a crazy meet. Obviously being pretty down after the (100-meter breaststroke) then being able to come back and do really well in the (200-meter breaststroke) was pretty cool. But yeah, it's exciting to see that I've been able to be super consistent throughout the last five years, which is something that's really hard to do.\" King bounced back from a bronze-medal finish in the 100-meter breaststroke -- an event she was favored to win -- to earn silver in the 200-meter breaststroke and 4x100-meter medley, helping the U.S. women earn a leading 18 swimming medals in Tokyo. Those two medals were far from King's only contributions. King made the \"seamless transition\" into a leader during the 2021 Games, helping first-time Olympians Lydia Jacoby (17), Claire Curzan (17), Torri Huske (18), Regan Smith (19) and Emma Weyant (19) all earn medals of their own. \"It was just kind of a crazy ride, and we all had to learn to navigate it together,\" King said. \"I think it turned out pretty well.\" King's next ride is the 2021 International Swimming League season, which will air on CBS and CBS Sports Network. You can catch the opening weekend Aug. 28 on CBS Sports Network and Aug. 29 on CBS, at noon ET each day. Her Cali Condors won the ISL Grand Final in 2020, the league's second year, and are hoping to defend their title in Naples, Italy, this fall. The Condors are led by a slew of 2020 Tokyo Olympics medalists in King, reigning ISL MVP Caeleb Dressel, Olivia Smoliga and Hali Flickinger. But despite their recent success in the Olympic pool, King emphasized that production won't directly translate to the ISL. Their team chemistry, however, will. \"It's definitely very different, different game, different scenario,\" King said. \"We got a lot of people returning from the team from last year, and we have a lot of fun together, honestly. We just win and goof off and train hard and swim fast, so it's a really great group of people, and we just build off that team chemistry and it usually works pretty well for us.\" While King is confident in the Condors' talent and camaraderie, she admits \"we were probably a little more hungry\" in their title-winning 2020 season compared to 2021. King plans to regain that hunger through her disdain for the competition. \"We just kind of hate the other teams,\" King said. \"We're really proud to be Condors, and we don't really get along that well with the other teams, to be honest. I think really that hatred of losing is what drives us.\" The ISL's regular season is slated for Aug. 26-Sept. 26 in Naples, Italy. King's Instagram-famous cat, Minnie, won't make the trip, but the 24-year-old Indiana native will be there with the positive attitude and newly-refined leadership skills responsible for her five Olympic medals and ISL championship. \"It's going to be fun,\" King said. \"That's kind of why we do this and why we swim.

Her highlight though, came in a post-race interview with NBC Sports, calling her return \"great\" -- and staking her claim as one of the world's top track-and-field athletes despite the disappointing finish.(Warning: NSFW language) \"I'm not upset with myself at all,\" Richardson said. \"This is one race. I'm not done. You know what I'm capable of. Count me out if you want to. Talk all the s--t you want because I'm here to stay. I'm not done.

Like in Tokyo, Thompson-Herah took gold, Fraser-Pryce won silver and Jackson took bronze. Daniels finished fourth while Oliver placed sixth. Richardson finished ninth with a 11.14, well below her personal-best of 10.72 -- the sixth-fastest time in the event's history -- and 10.86 from the Olympic Trials. Hours before those Olympic Trials, Richardson used marijuana to cope with the death of her mother. While USA Track and Field described the situation as \"incredibly unfortunate\" and \"devastating,\" it did not reverse Richardson's one-month suspension that would've allowed her to compete in the Tokyo Olympics. \"That sent me in a state of mind, in a state of emotional panic, if anything,\" Richardson said of her mother's passing. \"During all that, I still, even though I'm here, I still have to go out and put on a performance for my dream.\" While the 21-year-old Richardson struggled in the Prefontaine Classic, Thompson-Herah bolstered her growing legend. Thompson-Herah, who earned three gold medals (100-meter, 200-meter and 4x100-meter relay) in Tokyo,\u00a0 posted the second-fastest women's 100 meters time in history with a 10.54. Florence Griffith Joyner's world record of 10.49 has stood since 1988.

The \"New Balance x Sydney Signature Collection\" -- which features everything from warm-up ponchos to jumpsuits and sneakers, all intended to support performance and fashion -- is \"very authentic to who I am and the message I want to get across.\" New Balance openly received McLaughlin and her message during the design and styling process. \"From the first meeting to the final approval process Syd has been so engaged in bringing this to life,\" New Balance apparel designer Rachel Walder said in a statement. \"Her drive on the track easily transitioned to the design of this collection.

That would be far from the only record she'd go on to break. In June's Olympic trials, McLaughlin became the first woman to shatter the 52-second barrier in the women's 400-meter hurdles by finishing in 51.90. She then bested that world-record time by a whopping 44 tenths of a second to win the event's gold medal in Tokyo. McLaughlin also took home gold in the women's 4x400-meter relay in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, a win that gave fellow American Allyson Felix her record 11th medal. That experience was \"amazing\" and \"really special\" for McLaughlin, who idolized the five-time Olympian Felix since she was roughly eight years old. Despite being atop her sport, McLaughlin continues her strive to improve thanks to her \"be the first you\" motto -- one prominently featured in the \"New Balance x Sydney Signature Collection.\" Her symbol for the motto is a butterfly. To McLaughlin, butterflies represent \"the idea of evolving into your true version of yourself, who you're meant to be.\" The athlete McLaughlin is meant to be, in her view, has yet to arrive. \"I think it's just the idea of constantly wanting to improve,\" McLaughlin said. \"I've never had a perfect race. I think there's so much growth for me to attain. My coach and I are constantly just pushing the boundaries for myself and really striving in every single race to be better than I was before.

According to a translation from The Guardian, Hoermann said the international equestrian rules require an \"urgent overhaul.\" \"The numerous occasions at the competition yesterday, from literally the first to the last rider, are, we believe, unacceptable,\" Hoermann said. \"They endanger animal welfare and therefore damage the reputation of the sport and the sports men and women.\" Germany, Hoermann's home country, was directly involved in the Olympic pentathlon drama.

Earlier in the competition, Saint Boy refused to allow the Russian Olympic Committee's Gulnaz Gubaydullina to ride him.

Decades of falling asleep thinking about ... what? Slipping a piece of fabric that loops through a heavy gold disc around your neck? Entering the stadium with 10,000 people rumbling your name? The ecstasy of experiencing competition with another at a level so deep and so unrecognizable that it plays out not in a pool but in one's soul? What is the cost of these dreams, though? For most, it is in the past. The hours that were inputted, the opportunities that were forgone, the relationships that were paused. The two-week stretch in Tokyo with the curtain drawn to the world is the end of that cost. It is the payoff, or a portion of it. That's the joy you see on so many faces. The delight that perhaps the sacrifice was worthy. For some, though, what has been paid in the past pales in comparison to what will come due for the rest of their lives. When you are historically great, you never escape people wanting you to do the thing that made them feel the way they felt that one time you did it so memorably. Even if they don't say it to you, that is the eternal subtext. Swim like you did in Beijing, Michael. Play like you did at Augusta, Tiger. Dunk like you did when you were 23, Vince. I read a haunting quote last week from one of the preeminent athletes at these Summer Games. It was uttered in the wake of a week-long competition that thrives on drama, rivalry and numbers measured by the hundredth. Here is the quote: \"The sport was a lot more fun when no one knew my name, to be honest.\" Who do you think said that? You might think it was Novak Djokovic, Naomi Osaka or Simone Biles, all of whom exited earlier than expected at these Games. All very famous athletes -- all struggling with the mental and physical consequences of being very famous athletes. This is a conversation almost exclusive to those who have The Gift. The ones with talents nearly beyond their own ability to tend to them. This is not to say that the most gifted do not work hard because, in fact, if they did not work as hard or harder than anyone then we would never know they had The Gift to begin with. So few receive The Gift, even fewer do something with it. The Gift begets success and success begets fame. Fame begets everything else, including, insidiously so at these Olympic Games, the weight of expectations. The cost of these dreams for those with The Gift is the expectation not that the experience would be wonderful for you but that you would make it wonderful for me. Never has it been easier to hear that drumbeat that, I suspect, has always existed. Never has it been harder to tune it out. The burden of that is more than anyone was ever meant to bear. Caeleb Dressel, arguably the most decorated athlete at these Olympics, uttered the quote above. Its biggest star. The one whose fame and renown changed the most from two weeks ago. The most successful by the standards of most people in the world. The implication here should be obvious: sport and competition are fun, manifesting Atlas is not. In my country, there are two currencies. I don't know the cultural nuances of other countries, but in the United States you either deal in fame or you deal in money. Both can be spent to consolidate power. Those are, presumably, what everyone is after as a gateway to happiness and peace, and the ones with The Gift usually receive oodles of both. Yet how rarely do those who achieve what we all say we want to achieve find happiness and peace? I cover golf, so I always think of Tiger Woods when I think of The Gift. I think of the story -- perhaps apocryphal, but nonetheless the absolute perfect description of his life -- about his answer to why he enjoyed going out on his boat, named Privacy (!), so much. He apparently said because when you stare at all the fish, none of them stare back at you. The Gift, it turns out, comes with a curse. Fame is ostensibly one of the benefits of success, but the cold reality seems to be that the weight of it is actually its greatest cost. There's a famous Jim Carrey quote about fame. Many of you have probably heard it, but it doesn't get talked about enough. It doesn't get posted as a warning sign to our wide-eyed 17-year-olds enough: \"I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it's not the answer.\" Damn. The No. 1 story from the Tokyo Olympics was those who did not participate. I am extremely disinterested in the micro-tentacles of Simone Biles' decision to withdraw from the gymnastics competition altogether. There is a time and a place to dissect such decisions, and a world in which only those who enter the arena have authority to critique is both ridiculous and undesirable for all. There are, however, so many nuances to her specific situation and, broadly speaking, she deserves all the benefit of the doubt in the world given both her history and the circumstances. What I am interested in is the creation of a culture in which this could be (and will be) commonplace. That's the conversation here. If you think Biles should have persevered because -- what is the ubiquitous narrative here? -- that's what American athletes do, by golly (!), then maybe this is a conversation for you. I think about Biles going to Rio in 2016, a teenager with immense hopes. Much has happened since then, and all of it can be summed up in what Padraig Harrington, of all people, said at the 2021 PGA Championship. In golf circles, we have gone back to this quote so many times over the last few months: \"People often ask, in a general term, about experience. Well, as you gain experience, you lose innocence. I suppose if you drew a graph, there's a crossing point of equilibrium where you have some experience and a certain amount of innocence and enthusiasm. As you get a little bit older and you get all this experience, on paper people might think you get better with experience. But as I said, you've seen a few things that you know in your game that you probably never wanted to see, so you kind of lose that little bit of, I suppose, innocence. It's not everything it's cracked up to be to have experience.\" Biles, more or less, said the same thing last week about the time before the time when everyone knew her name. She was talking about the details of her sport (and so was Harrington), but it doesn't take a huge leap to apply the same principle to what happens outside of it. \"I'm a little bit more scared of my skills now,\" Biles said. \"Because whenever I was younger, I was pretty fearless. But now I'm just like, 'Okay, I'm getting older. This could go wrong, this could go wrong, that could do this.' And so, that kind of scares me a little bit.\" Innocence should be protected at all costs within an athlete's world. If you are a manager or an agent or a coach, it is the most valuable asset you can manage because it is the most fleeting. \"The sport was a lot more fun when no one knew my name.\" There are many angles to this problem. The internet has exacerbated everything. Our identities become wrapped up in who other people say that we are. We have bequeathed the base, human question, \"Will I be loved?\" to folks who have no authority on the matter. We want all information at all times in all places on all devices without considering either the monetary or cultural costs. We are reaping what others have sown. Some of this is on those with The Gift. You don't have to be on Instagram or do the P&G ads or the \"Today With Hoda & Jenna\" interviews. But stiff-arming the spotlight can feel like trying to stop an avalanche with a snow shovel. Given the tiny window you have to cash in, I'm sure it can feel unwise. Never has it been more demanding to be a world-class athlete. You have to do the thing that you do better than anyone else, but then you are also expected to do 25 other things that you were not trained to do -- and do them well every single day with almost no reprieve. I think a lot about a quote from Rory McIlroy's uncle in this great Golf Digest cover story by Jaime Diaz. Rory is another of those with The Gift, and he has warred with himself about how to handle it for a long time. \"Time has become his most precious commodity,\" said Brian McIlroy. \"He is absolutely delighted on those days when there is nothing he has to do.\" The sport was a lot more fun when no one knew my name. I don't know what we do here. I think we're in too deep. I am part of the problem. We all have a part in it. I desire a healthier path forward for us as a society and for those who are toddlers but have already been predisposed with The Gift. I don't want future Michael Phelps' to contemplate suicide because the gravity around them is heavier than it should be. There's a great proverb from the Bible (Proverbs 30:8) that could apply to all of this and to our path forward: \"Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me \u2026\" Give me neither poverty nor riches. Who among us is brave enough, is humble enough to ask for such a thing? In so many instances, I am not. For most athletes that competed at the Tokyo Games, the cost of these dreams ended on Sunday. That's it. For some \u2013 a handful or so with The Gift \u2013 they will steal away and try to wriggle out of it. Maybe they will retire and come back later in a different role, like Phelps has done. Maybe they feel stuck. Maybe they will re-enter the grind. For as much joy and wonder and gold as the Olympics brings, it also brings a sliver of sadness. Because though most have paid the price and received their reward in Tokyo, for some the cost of these dreams can feel like it has no end.", "list": null, "preprocessed": "olympics dream decade fall

Shanna McCarriston back with tons of news from the sports world. Hope you had a wonderful weekend and enjoyed the final events of the Olympics. Last night was the Pro Football Hall of Fame ceremony and I loved watching highlights of the players in the 2021 class and listening to stories from their careers. I grew up watching Peyton Manning play (many times losing to Tom Brady \ud83d\ude04) so it felt wild to see him secure his place in football history. We will talk about the ceremony more in today's newsletter, but before we get to that, we have some other stuff to discuss, such as the top Olympic moments, Lionel Messi and more. Let's get to it. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics have come and gone, and they brought us some incredible moments from the top athletes around the world. The United States took home the most medals of any country with 113. Team USA combined for 39 gold, 41 silver and 33 bronze. China took home the second-most with 88, while host country Japan finished the Games with 58. There were many incredible Team USA moments to choose from as the best, and here are just a few: One of my favorite moments was easily the women's basketball team winning their seventh gold medal. Dominance in any sport is difficult enough, but it's especially hard when you are going against the best in the world. Simply put, Team USA always finds a way to win. Bird and Taurasi making history by becoming the first basketball players, man or woman, to win five Olympic gold medals is the icing on the cake. For full commentary on all the top moments, click here. Lionel Messi\u00a0has said his goodbyes to Barcelona and is now likely headed to Paris Saint-Germain. Messi's time with Barcelona, the only club he's played for, ended with an emotional press conference this past weekend. He discussed what the city and team meant to him, and did so through many tears. The superstar is now reportedly headed to play with PSG, according to CBS Sports' Fabrizio Romano -- who in great detail explained how Messi's split with Barcelona happened. Here is a look at the proposed details of his new contract: Some details still remain to be seen, as an official agreement has not been made yet. Last year, Messi revealed he wanted to leave Barcelona, which was the beginning of the end of his time with the club. His contractual situation was never settled due to La Liga salary cap issues, which led to this, but clearly he was not totally emotionally ready to leave Barcelona. Tom Brady is not thrilled with his fellow players. He said so much over the weekend,\u00a0calling them \"ignorant\" on social media. The defending champion seemed to be upset that the NFL's salary cap went down, even though the value of every team in the league increased by an average of 14% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the current salary cap is set at $182.5 million -- a 20% decrease. The team with the biggest increase in value? None other than Brady's Buccaneers, whose value went up by 29%. Here's what Brady's problem with all of this is, in his own words: Strong words from Brady, who would likely want to see the NFLPA negotiate a better collective bargaining agreement in the future. Ultimately, the seven-time champion isn't thrilled that the owners seem to be getting a better deal from the players, but as CBS Sports' John Breech pointed out, it's not that clear cut. Salary cap goes hand-in-hand with total revenue, which went down $4 billion during the coronavirus pandemic. Owners could counter argue that they took those losses while players got what they were promised. Regardless, the cap likely will increase from now on, with a 2022 cap going as high as $208.2, a 14% increase over 2021, the league announced. College Football Hall of Fame coach Bobby Bowden died at 91 on Sunday. Just weeks ago, the Florida State legend announced that he was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Bowden's son, Terry Bowden, later confirmed that his father had pancreatic cancer. Bowden's time with Florida State football -- all 34 years --elevated the program beyond measure in Tallahassee. Here's a snapshot of his 40-year career as a major college coach: Following his death this weekend,\u00a0friends, family, players and fans expressed their condolences for the coach on social media. \u26be Reds vs. Indians, 6:10 p.m.\u00a0|\u00a0CLE +150 | TV: MLB.TV \u26be White Sox vs. Twins, 8:10 p.m.\u00a0|\u00a0MIN +170 | TV: ESPN \u26be Yankees vs. Royals, 8:10 p.m. | KC +157 | TV: MLB.TV As someone who started watching football in 2001 at the young age of six, Peyton Manning was a face I watched for my entire childhood. Sometimes I watched him with hatred (those six times he beat Brady and the Patriots), sometimes I thanked him for his interceptions in Foxboro or on the road (the 11 times he was defeated by Bill Belichick's crew) and sometimes I watched him and laughed when he was in commercials or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" No matter what, though, I always watched him with respect, even as a rival to my hometown team. Watching his Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinement, with his rival-turned-friend Brady in his personal section, felt like a culmination of the time I started to love football. He joked that Brady won't retire until 2035, referencing how the 44-year-old just doesn't ever seem to be nearing his career.

Games were definitely ones to remember. Established stars such as Katie Ledecky and Kevin Durant delivered on their sky-high expectations while new ones emerged in first-time Team USA Olympians Sydney McLaughlin, Suni Lee and more. Allyson Felix became the most decorated track and field Olympian in U.S. history by winning her 11th career medal while swimmer Caeleb Dressel collected an impressive five golds in Tokyo. The U.S. also swept the men's and women's golf and basketball competitions. Overall, the U.S. claimed an Olympics-leading 113 medals (39 gold, 41 silver, 33 bronze). COUNTRY GOLD SILVER BRONZE TOTALS United States 39 41 33 113 China 38 32 18 88 Japan 27 14 17 58 Great Britain 22 21 22 65 Russian Olympic Committee 20 28 23 71 Here are our top 10 memories from Tokyo. In the women's 200m final, Katie Ledecky shockingly placed fifth -- her worst ever Olympic finish -- and more than a half second out of medal position. The now 10-time Olympic medalist (seven gold, three silver) emphatically rebounded just over an hour later. Ledecky (15:37.34) dominated the Olympics' first ever women's 1500m final, finishing more than four seconds faster than her fellow American and silver medalist Erica Sullivan (15:41.41). Germany's Sarah Kohler earned bronze with a time of 15:42.91. The 24-year-old Ledecky finished her 2020 Tokyo Olympics campaign with four medals. \"I've gained perspective over the years,\" Ledecky said. \"I've really learned a lot over the years. The times (in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics) might not be my best times, but I'm still really, really happy that I have a gold medal around my neck right now.\" After the \"twisties\" forced Simone Biles to withdraw from four gymnastics finals, a return from the two-time Olympian looked unlikely. But in typical Biles fashion, she rose to glory when it mattered most. Biles delivered a 14.000 in the women's balance beam final to earn her second consecutive Olympic bronze in the event. China's Guan Chenchen and Tang Xijing finished 1-2 with scores of 14.633 and 14.233, respectively. Biles, who also won silver in this year's team competition, is now a seven-time Olympic medalist (four gold, one silver, two bronze). \"I'm proud of myself for the way I pushed through and even learned that dismount that I haven't done in years,\" Biles told the \"TODAY\" show. \"And just put up a good set, that's all I really wanted. I wasn't expecting to walk away with a medal or anything, I just wanted to go out there and do it for myself. And I did.\" As expected, an American won the women's 100m breaststroke. The unexpected: it wasn't the reigning Olympic gold medalist Lilly King. Lydia Jacoby, a 17-year-old Alaskan, stunned the pool and viewing audience by finishing ahead of both King (1:05.54) and South Africa's Tatjana Schoenmaker (1:05.22) to win gold. The win by Jacoby gave Alaska its first ever Olympic swimming medal. When Jacoby also took home silver in the 4x100m medley relay, she joined alpine skier Tommy Moe as the only Alaskans to win more than one medal in a single Olympics. \"It was crazy,\" Jacoby said. \"I was definitely racing for a medal. I knew I had it in me, but I wasn't really expecting a gold medal. When I looked up at the scoreboard, it was insane.\" In the lead-up to these Olympics, 24-year-old Caeleb Dressel was considered a potential successor to the GOAT -- otherwise known as Michael Phelps. Dressel lived up to the hype in his very first race of the 2021 Games. In the men's 4x100m freestyle, Dressel led the U.S. to gold by swimming a blazing-fast time of 47.26 as the first leg. The Americans finished with third-fastest time ever in the event, a 3:08.97, while Italy (3:10.11) and Australia (3:10.22) finished second and third, respectively. Dressel eventually won four additional golds in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. \"I felt good the whole way, I knew I had to get my hand in the wall first and get some clean water,\" Dressel said. \"And everyone did their job. It's a relay for a reason, it's four guys for a reason, it's certainly not just me. It's certainly not just one guy.\" When the reigning gold medalist Biles withdrew from the women's all-around competition, she opened the door for a new champion. Fellow American and first-time Olympian Suni Lee took full advantage. The 18-year-old Lee collected her first gold medal with a score of 57.433, above the silver medalist Rebeca Andrade (57.298) of Brazil and Angeline Melnikova (57.199) of the Russian Olympic Committee. Lee, who came into these Games as the first ever Hmong-American Olympic gymnast, made additional history by becoming the ethnic group's first medalist. \"I really want to be an inspiration to others and help others reach their dreams,\" Lee told the \"TODAY\" show. An opening group play loss to France marred the Americans' start to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but Team USA left the Games with exactly what it wanted: its fourth consecutive gold medal. Kevin Durant contributed a team-leading 29 points along with six rebounds and three assists in a rematch with France in the men's basketball final, an 87-82 victory for the Americans, earning his third gold. Only Carmelo Anthony -- who Durant passed on Team USA's all-time scoring list in these Games -- has as many golds as Durant now among all-time men's basketball Olympians. Jayson Tatum added 19 points -- on an efficient 8-of-14 shooting -- and a team-high seven rebounds in the final. \"I know it seems as if it's come easy for so long, but I played in 2016 and it wasn't easy then and it wasn't easy this year,\" Team USA's Draymond Green said. \"Don't get me wrong, I don't take either one of them for granted, but this one just feels a lot sweeter.\" The women's 400m hurdle featured eight athletes, but most eyes were only on two: Americans Sydney McLaughlin and reigning gold medalist Dalilah Muhammad. Muhammad and McLaughlin came into the event in a tier of their own, with the two women setting the last two world records in the event. The pair continued their record-breaking trend in Tokyo, adding the second and third ever sub-52 second finishes by a woman in the event's history. McLaughlin earned gold with a time of 51.46 while Muhammad earned silver with a 51.58. At 21, McLaughlin became the youngest women's 400m hurdles Olympic gold medalist ever. \"I saw Dalilah ahead of me with one to go,\" McLaughlin said. \"I just thought 'Run your race'. \"The race doesn't really start till hurdle seven and I just wanted to go out there and give it everything I had.\" Less than a week after Xander Schauffele gave the U.S. its first men's gold medal in golf since 1900, Nelly Korda did the same on the women's side. Korda posted a 17-under 267 to secure a one-shot victory over Japan's Mone Inami and Australia's Lydia Ko, who each posted 16-under 268s. Inami bested Ko in a playoff to earn silver. Korda, the world's top-ranked golfer, battled rainy conditions in Tokyo for her eventual victory. In addition to her Olympic success, Korda has three LPGA wins to her name this year. \"It's tough to win out here and she makes it look easy,\" said Jessica Korda, Nelly's sister and fellow competitor in the Tokyo Games. \"But these girls are good. Look at the leaderboard every week. This is how it is. So for her to be doing what she's doing is insane to me. But at the same time, it's so cool. This is like total G.O.A.T. status for me.\" Allyson Felix came into the women's 4x400m relay final with a chance at passing fellow American Carl Lewis for the most track and field medals ever by an American athlete, and she accomplished exactly that. Team USA -- led by Sydney McLaughlin, Felix, Dalilah Muhammad and Athing Mu -- won gold with a season-best time of 3:16.85. Poland (3:20.53) and Jamaica (3:21.24) finished with silver and bronze, respectively. The win gave Felix her record 11th medal, a storybook ending to the career of one of the most prolific Olympians ever. \"It's an amazing group of women right here,\" McLaughlin said. \"Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I think we all just knew going in it was going to be fast. All we had to do is do our part and just have fun with it.\" Brittney Griner missed only four of her 18 shots in a dominant 30-point, three-block performance against Japan, helping Team USA collect a 90-75 win in the women's basketball gold medal game. Her 30 points set a women's gold-medal game record. This was Team USA's seventh consecutive gold medal with Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi being a part of the last five, making them the most decorated basketball players in Olympic history. This is likely the final Olympics for Bird -- who confirmed she won't be back for Paris 2024 -- and Taurasi -- who indicated she will not return -- and they couldn't have asked for a better finish. \"There's always a lot of pressure when you put this jersey on,\" Taurasi said. \"I think you learn a lot about yourself when you play with the national team. It's always a collection of 12 of the best players in the world and you have to set yourself aside and come together to win, and it's not easy and it comes in different forms but we always find a way to do that and do it with class and team first. It's pretty amazing. It teaches you a lot about yourself and other people.\"", "list": null, "preprocessed": "2020 tokyo olympics wrap game definitely one remember establish star katie ledecky kevin durant deliver sky

The most dominant female swimmer in history cemented her status and immortalized her legend in her final race of 2021 with her signature discipline. Ledecky touched the wall in 8:12.57, giving her the sixth individual gold and 10th Olympic medal of her career. Her six individual gold medals are now the most by any female U.S. Olympian ever and second-most in swimming to one person: Michael Phelps may forever hold an untouchable number with 13. But for as phenomenal as Phelps' five-Olympiad career was, it's Ledecky who commands a dominance in certain parts of swimming we've simply never seen before. Her supremacy specifically in the 800-meter freestyle might represent the most inevitable any athlete has been at anything ... ever? Sounds like hyperbole? It's not. It's not that she always wins, it's that she has defined the parameters of what success is in the women's 800-meter freestyle. Ledecky owns\u00a0the 22 best times in the history of the event. This is obscene authority. Her latest gold also meant achieving a three-peat in the 800 free. It marks just the fourth time in history a swimmer has won gold in an individual discipline in three consecutive Olympics. (Phelps' four straight in the 200-meter individual medley has never been matched.) Saturday's 8:12.57 pace was ho-hum by Ledecky standards; it was merely the 16th-fastest time she's logged. Ledecky, 24, beat out rival Ariarne Titmus, 20, who was not the same swimmer in the 800 as she was when Titmus beat Ledecky earlier in the week in the 200- and 400-meter freestyles. The Aussie hung close the entire race but never truly threatened Ledecky. Titmus touched in 8:13.83. Consider this: Titmus' silver-winning swim on Saturday was the fastest non-Ledecky time in the history of the women's 800-meter freestyle. It barely bested the 23rd-best time of Ledecky's career. Laughable! And now these two will almost certainly get to meet again in three years, when the Games will head to Paris. With that, it's likely\u00a0there will be no bigger storyline for the 2024 Summer Olympics than Ledecky vs. Titmus. That's right: Ledecky's Olympic career isn't over. While there wasn't too much speculation over this, it's nonetheless news that Ledecky went on record for the first time at these Games to state she is not retiring. \"That was not my last swim -- I'm at least going to '24,\" Ledecky said on NBC. \"Maybe '28, we'll see. But I knew [the 800] was going to be my last swim here. You never take anything for granted, you don't know if you're going to be back at the next Olympics, so just try to soak it all in.\" Ledecky and Titmus wound up splitting their four head-to-head meets in Tokyo, with Titmus taking gold in the 200 and 400 free, while Ledecky won in the 800 free and easily cruised in the first-ever Olympic 1,500-meter freestyle for women. (Titmus did not swim in that event.) In the 4x200 free relay, Ledecky swam the fastest leg (1:53.76) of any swimmer to lift the U.S. to a silver -- and edge Titmus and the Australians (bronze) in the process. \"It's awesome,\" Ledecky said on NBC. \"I just wanted to finish on a really good note, and I'm just so happy.\" With Ledecky's Tokyo action now complete, a recap of what she went through in a six-day stretch. These are only the finals; we're not even accounting for the prelims and semifinal heats she had to swim in as well. No swimmer logged more laps in the pool in Tokyo than Ledecky. Four medals in a six-day span. Ledecky was the only swimmer to compete in a \"sprint\" race (the 200 free) and the 1,500. Think of it this way: You don't see track athletes compete in the 100- or 200-meter dash and also run the 1,500, or 5,000, or 10,000 meters. She's different from any Olympian we've ever watched. It's been Ledecky's successes, in addition to her not taking gold in two of the five events she competed in, that's helped remind us that Olympic greatness can be about transcendent dominance -- but also shortcomings that humanize these athletes. An important facet of the Olympics is that they allow for non-binary results (not just one winner and all losers, but three medals to hand out) and make sports fans -- American sports fans in particular -- reconsider what elite achievement is. Katie Ledecky is not undefeated in the pool; no one ever is. But she's special and unlike anyone we've seen before. She's beatable, but she's unique. And with this showing in Tokyo -- two more golds, two more silvers -- Ledecky has unequivocally elevated herself to her own tier of Olympic greatness. She didn't need to sweep and take five golds to get there. A lesson to be applied. The best part is it's not over. Ledecky wasn't the force of nature in Tokyo that she was in Rio in 2016, which was clearly her peak. But in the presence of a true foil in Titmus, and with a race regimen that was viciously grueling, Ledecky proved she has no analog.", "list": ["July 26: Wins silver in 400 free; first time ever Ledecky doesn't win gold in an individual Olympic event", "July 28: Finishes fifth in 200 free", "July 28: Less than 90 minutes after the 200 free, wins gold in 1,500 free", "July 29: Wins Team USA silver by swimming final leg -- and fastest split among all swimmers -- in 4x200 free relay\u00a0", "July 31: Wins third straight gold in 800 free"], "preprocessed": "one preposterous streak sport remain active saturday morning tokyo katie ledecky undefeated every 800 meter freestyle race compete 11 year dominant female swimmer history cement status immortalize legend final race 2021 signature discipline ledecky touch wall 8:12.57 give sixth individual gold 10th olympic medal career six individual gold medal female u.s olympian ever second swim one person michael phelps may forever hold untouchable number 13 phenomenal phelps five olympiad career ledecky command dominance certain part swimming simply never see supremacy specifically 800 meter freestyle might represent inevitable athlete anything ever sound like hyperbole always win define parameter success woman 800 meter freestyle ledecky own \u00a0 22 good time history event obscene authority late gold also mean achieve three peat 800 free mark fourth time history swimmer gold individual discipline three consecutive olympic phelps four straight 200 meter individual medley never match saturday 8:12.57 pace ho hum ledecky standard merely 16th fast time log ledecky 24 beat rival ariarne titmus 20 swimmer 800 titmus beat ledecky early week 200- 400 meter freestyle aussie hang close entire race never truly threaten ledecky titmus touch 8:13.83 consider titmus silver win swim saturday fast non ledecky time history woman 800 meter freestyle barely best 23rd good time ledecky career laughable two almost certainly get meet three year game head paris likely \u00a0 big storyline 2024 summer olympics ledecky vs. titmus right ledecky olympic career much speculation nonetheless news ledecky go record first time game state retire last swim least go 24 ledecky say nbc maybe 28 see know 800 go last swim never take anything grant know go back next olympic try soak ledecky titmus wind split four head head meet tokyo titmus take gold 200 400 free ledecky 800 free easily cruise first ever olympic 1,500 meter freestyle woman titmus swim event 4x200 free relay ledecky swam fast leg 1:53.76 swimmer lift u.s silver edge titmus australian bronze process awesome ledecky say nbc want finish really good note happy ledecky tokyo action complete recap go six day stretch final even account prelim semifinal heat swim well swimmer log lap pool tokyo ledecky four medal six day span ledecky swimmer compete sprint race 200 free 1,500 think way see track athlete compete 100- 200 meter dash also run 1,500 5,000 10,000 meter different olympian ever watch ledecky success addition take gold two five event compete help remind we olympic greatness transcendent dominance also shortcoming humanize athlete important facet olympics allow non binary result one winner loser three medal hand make sport fan american sport fan particular reconsider elite achievement katie ledecky undefeated pool one ever special unlike anyone see beatable unique showing tokyo two gold two silver ledecky unequivocally elevate tier olympic greatness need sweep take five gold get lesson apply good part ledecky force nature tokyo rio 2016 clearly peak presence true foil titmus race regimen viciously grueling ledecky prove analog"}, {"link": "https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/2020-tokyo-olympics-womens-basketball-tournament-tv-schedule-as-team-usa-faces-japan-for-gold-medal/", "title": "2020 Tokyo Olympics: Women's basketball tournament TV schedule as Team USA faces Japan for gold medal", "subtitle": "Breaking down everything you need to know about women's basketball at the Summer Olympic Games in Japan", "author": "Jasmyn Wimbish", "date": "8/8/2021", "time": "4:39", "section": ["Standings: Preliminary group stage", "Preliminary group stage round", "Quarterfinals", "Semifinals", "Bronze Medal Game", "Gold Medal Game", ""], "body": "The U.S. women's basketball team is battling in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as it tries to win its seventh straight gold medal.

The United States faces Japan in the gold medal game in a rematch from group play. Team USA triumphed by a margin of 86-69 in the first matchup. Japan has not lost another game in the tournament and is playing at a high level as the challenger. Tip-off is scheduled for 10:30 p.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Team USA women's basketball as the 18-point favorite in the latest USA vs. Japan odds. The over-under for total points expected is listed at 161. Before finalizing any Japan vs. USA gold medal women's basketball picks or predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics nearing a conclusion, Tierney has analyzed Saturday's USA vs. Japan gold medal matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 basketball odds and betting trends for Japan vs. USA: USA is the most talented team in the field and it shows in the results. After a nine-point win in the opener, the Americans have won every game by double figures, including back-to-back wins by at least 20 points during the knockout stage. Team USA has size, athleticism and physicality that no opponent can match, and the Americans proved earlier in the tournament that they can handle Japan's playing style on the way to a 17-point win. Team USA has won an amazing 54 straight games in Olympic play, and is aiming for its seventh straight gold medal. On top of that, Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi are looking to become the first basketball players to win five gold medals, and the United States hasn't lost a game at the Olympics since 1992 in Barcelona. Japan is dangerous due to its shooting and passing prowess, but the Americans are heavy favorites for a reason. Japan is a strong offensive team that is dangerous against any opponent. It is tied for the tournament scoring lead at 83.6 points per game, and Japan is leading the entire field in 3-pointers (13.0 per game), 3-point attempts (31.8 per game) and 3-point percentage (40.9 percent). Some of that effectiveness stems from raw shooting talent, but Japan is also an elite passing team. The Japanese average 23.6 assists per game as a team, taking advantage of fantastic ball movement and player movement, and Japan also has the fewest turnovers (10.6 per game) in the field. Rui Machida is the embodiment of Japan's offensive attack, and she is lapping the entire field in averaging 13.8 assists per game during the Olympics. Machida generates 5.3 assists for every turnover she commits and, when compared to the United States, Japan's ball security could be huge. Team USA is averaging the second-most turnovers (17.8 per game) in the entire field, and that could swing things in Japan's direction. Tierney is leaning under on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the Team USA vs. Japan spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball predictions at SportsLine. So who wins the USA vs. Japan in the gold medal game for women's basketball? And which side of the Japan vs. USA spread is a must-back?

It is the fourth straight Olympic gold for the Americans. As he has been for the majority of the tournament, Kevin Durant was spectacular for Team USA as he finished the win with 29 points to go along with six rebounds and three assists. Jayson Tatum stepped up to provide Durant with the most help on the offensive end, finishing with 19 points to join Damian Lillard and Jrue Holiday as double-digit scorers as the guards finished the game with 11 points apiece. Team USA is coached by San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who is the successor to Mike Krzyzewski. Popovich previously won a bronze medal as an assistant coach under Larry Brown at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Joining Popovich on the coaching staff are\u00a0Golden State Warriors\u00a0coach Steve Kerr, Indiana Pacers assistant coach Lloyd Pierce and Villanova University coach Jay Wright. The Olympics opened on July 23 in Tokyo. The group stage of the Olympic basketball tournament took place from July 25 to Aug. 1, and the knockout stage will run from Aug. 3-7.

Here's what to watch on Saturday, Day 16 of the Games, and a quick recap of all the Olympic action that transpired on Friday. Stay up to date with how countries are performing at the Games by checking out our medal counter. Team USA collected its fourth consecutive gold medal in a 87-82 victory over a France team led by Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier. Kevin Durant scored a team-leading 29 points for the U.S. while adding six rebounds and three assists. The 32-year-old forward now joins Carmelo Anthony -- who he just passed on Team USA's all-time scoring list -- as the only three-time men's basketball gold medalists in Olympic history. Fellow American Jayson Tatum contributed 19 points and seven rebounds. American Molly Seidel claimed bronze in the women's marathon, giving the U.S. its first women's marathon medal since Deena Kastor's bronze in 2004 and third all-time. Kenya's Peres Jepchirchir and Brigid Kosgei finished 1-2 and just above Seidel (2:27:46) with season-best times of 2:27:20 and 2:27:36, respectively. This was just the third ever marathon for Seidel, a four-time cross-country champion at Notre Dame, and she made the most of it. Nelly Korda, the world's top-ranked golfer, shot a 17-under 267 to win Team USA's first women's golf gold medal since 1900. She fended off strong competition from Japan's Mone Inami and Australia's Lydia Ko, who tied at 268, to win by a single stroke. Inami and Ko finished with silver and bronze, respectively, after they competed in a playoff for second. This is the Americans' second gold medal in golf in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, as Xander Schauffele won gold on the men's side last Sunday. The U.S. took home silver in the jumping team final, falling just shy of Sweden in a jump-off for gold. Belgium won bronze. American equestrian Laura Kraut, 55, became her country's oldest Olympic medalist since 1904. A two-time Olympian, Kraut also won gold in the team jumping event in the 2008 Beijing Games. McLain Ward and Jessica Springsteen, the daughter of singers Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa, won silver alongside Kraut in the event. This U.S.-Sweden matchup is a rematch of a prior classic, as the Americans bested the Swedes in a jump-off at the 2018 world championship. Team USA trotted out its biggest stars for the women's 4x400 relay final in Sydney McLaughlin, Allyson Felix, Dalilah Muhammad and Athing Mu. They were as dominant as advertised. The American foursome sped to a gold medal-winning time of 3:16.85, the event's fifth-fastest time ever. Poland finished second with a national-record time of 3:30.53 while Jamaica took bronze with a season-best 3:21.24. The silver gave the 35-year-old Felix -- who's competing in her fifth and final Games -- her 11th Olympic medal, the most by any U.S. track and field athlete in history. Her 10 coming into the race was tied with fellow American Carl Lewis. Men's track and field was largely a struggle for the U.S. in the 2021 Games, but its finish was anything but. Michael Cherry, Michael Norman, Bryce Deadmon and Rae Benjamin dominated the men's 4x400 relay, finishing with a season-best time of 2:55.70 -- well ahead of silver-medalist Netherlands (2:57.18) and bronze-medalist Botswana (2:57.18). This was the second of two U.S. men's track and field golds in Tokyo, the fewest it's ever had in a single Olympics. Ryan Crouser, the world-record shot-putter, was the other American gold-medal winner. Team USA won its first ever Olympic silver medal in a 2-0 loss to Japan in the men's baseball final. Japan, which won its first medal since 2004 and first ever gold, became the first host country to win an Olympic men's baseball final. American infielder Eddy Alvarez, who served as an opening ceremony flag bearer, became the third American in history to earn medals in both the summer and winter Olympics.

Inami and Ko posted matching 16-under 268s to finish with silver and bronze, respectively, as the pair competed in a playoff for the silver medal. \"It's crazy,\" Korda said after the win.\"It sounds absurd that I'm a gold medal [winner]. and I'm an Olympian.

Before finalizing any Australia vs. Slovenia picks or bronze medal basketball predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics nearing a conclusion, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Saturday's Slovenia vs. Australia bronze medal matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 basketball odds and betting trends for Australia vs. Slovenia: Slovenia has been an offensive juggernaut throughout the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, and that is its calling card. Doncic is an elite initiator, averaging 24.2 points, 10.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists per game, and the team leads the tournament in averaging 102.4 points per game. Slovenia is a tremendously efficient shooting team, making 49 percent of its shots overall, and it has the best 2-point shooting mark (61 percent) in the field. Slovenia's overall shot profile is analytically sound, with a tournament-leading 21.8 free-throw attempts per game and more 3-point attempts than any other squad. Finally, Slovenia's offense is well-rounded. Slovenia is grabbing 14.0 offensive rebounds per game, leading the Olympics, and is committing only 11.4 turnovers per contest. Australia is fully capable of scoring in bunches, but Slovenia's offensive track record is highly impressive and Doncic projects as the best player on the floor in the bronze medal matchup. Australia is a beautifully effective offensive team. The Australians are averaging more than 86 points per game in Tokyo, and a lot of that can be attributed to ball movement and perimeter shooting. Australia is No. 2 in the tournament in 3-point accuracy at more than 40 percent, and the Australians attempt more than 30 shots per game from long distance. Australia is also No. 2 in assists (24.8 per game), and it is generating nearly two assists for every turnover committed during the Olympics. Mills is the centerpiece of Australia's offensive approach, and the veteran guard is producing 19.6 points and 5.8 assists per game while connecting on 44 percent of his 3-point attempts. Joe Ingles, a standout of the Utah Jazz, adds supporting talent, and the Australians also boast other NBA talents in Matisse Thybulle, Dante Exum, Matthew Dellavedova and recently signed big man Jock Landale. Thybulle is a force defensively, averaging 3.0 steals per game in Tokyo, and Australia can create havoc for the high-powered Slovenia offense. Tierney has taken a close look at the Slovenia vs. Australia Olympic basketball matchup from all angles and is leaning under on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the Slovenia vs. Australia spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball picks and predictions at SportsLine. So which side of the Slovenia vs. Australia spread is a must-back?

Brazil came in as the second choice among oddsmakers for Olympics 2020 gold but has been more impressive in the tournament. Spain has looked fatigued and is struggling to score but boasts a ton of talent. Both had to fight hard to get here, with Brazil beating Mexico in a shootout after a 0-0 draw and Spain netting its goal in the 115th minute to beat Japan 1-0 in Tuesday's Tokyo 2020 semifinals. Each has won a gold medal, with each winning on its home turf -- Brazil at Rio 2016 and Spain at Barcelona 1992. Kickoff from Yokohama Stadium is set for 7:30 a.m ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Brazil as the slight +160 favorite (risk $100 to win $160) on the 90-minute money line in its latest Brazil vs. Spain odds, while Spain is the +190 underdog. The over-under for total goals scored is set at 1.5. Before you lock in your Spain vs. Brazil picks or 2020 Tokyo Olympics predictions, you need to see what consummate soccer insider Martin Green has to say. After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Since then, his European soccer picks have been spot-on. Green has generated nearly $19,000 for $100 bettors since the 2017-18 season, and he has his finger on the pulse of the game all over the globe. Now, Green has taken a close look at the Brazil vs. Spain matchup and revealed his 2020 Tokyo Olympics soccer picks. You can head to SportsLine now to see the picks. Here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Spain vs. Brazil: The Brazilians have lost two friendlies but have not lost in a competitive match in their last 12 (8-4-0) and are on a seven-game unbeaten run overall. They bunkered down against a tough Mexico squad but still had 67 percent possession and six shots on net before proving their class in the shootout. This under-23 team plays with the skill common of the Selecao senior team, with Everton's Richarlison and Hertha Berlin's Matheus Cunja forming a dangerous partnership up top. Richarlison is the tournament's top scorer with five goals, while Cunha has scored two. Brazil has won four medals in five appearances at the Summer Games, also winning two bronze and a silver, since the age restrictions were put in place in 1992. Spain has qualified just one other time since 2000, failing to advance in London in 2012. Brazil manager Andre Jardine chose to provide a safety net on defense for his young squad with his over-age selections. Captain Dani Alves, 38, and Sevilla's Diego Carlos, 28, anchor the unit, while 31-year-old goalkeeper Santos also provides leadership and has allowed just three goals in the five matches. The Spaniards have struggled to score goals, but the talent is certainly there. With Spanish law requiring club teams to release players for Olympic duty, the team had its pick of young players and three veterans. The squad includes six who played key roles in the team's Euro 2020 semifinal run last month. They have shown signs of fatigue, but they should find a second gear with gold on the line. The team also has plenty of depth if it ends up in extra time. Real Madrid's Marco Asensio, 25, is one of three over-age players and netted the winner against Japan. Asensio plays opposite Dani Olmo and Mikel Oyarzabal in a potent attack. Olmo also has a goal, while Oyarzabal has two, and Rafa Mir had a hat trick as a substitute to save the quarterfinal against Ivory Coast. Oyarzabal also can set up goals and has 19 assists over the past two seasons with Real Sociedad. Spain is solid in the back and has allowed just three goals in the five games. Barcelona's Eric Garcia and Villareal's Pau Torres are two of the world's best young defenders and are backed by Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Unai Simon. Green has taken a close look at the Brazil vs. Spain match from all sides, and he's leaning under on the goal total. He has two confident best bets and a full breakdown of this 2020 Tokyo Olympics gold-medal match. He's only sharing those expert soccer picks at SportsLine. So who wins Brazil vs. Spain?

The United States has not won gold in baseball since 2000 in Sydney. Meanwhile Japan has never won gold and has reached the gold medal game only once, in 1996. Baseball has been an Olympic sport since 1992 and was not contested in 2012 or '16. First pitch is set for 6 a.m. ET. Japan is the -200 favorite (risk $200 to win $100) in the latest USA vs. Japan odds from Caesars Sportsbook while the United States is the +170 underdog. The over-under for total runs scored is 8.5. Before making any Japan vs. United States picks, make sure you check out the Olympics 2020 predictions and betting advice from CBS Sports baseball guru Matt Snyder. A former player for Indiana University and a member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, Snyder has been a baseball writer with CBS Sports since 2011. CBS Sports' longest-tenured baseball expert combines simple logic learned from his baseball-playing days with an extensive background in analytics. He went 26-18 on his MLB picks in the 2020 MLB playoffs, including 8-4 on World Series bets. Now, Snyder has set his sights on the United States vs. Japan gold medal game and revealed his Olympic baseball picks and predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see his picks. Here are the Olympics baseball odds and betting trends for Japan vs. USA: The Japanese have their pitching lined up much better than the Americans. Japan has played one fewer game than the Americans and its pitchers have been rested since Wednesday -- all of its arms should be available. On Saturday the Japanese will start Masato Morishita, who allowed just two runs on five hits over five innings against Mexico on July 31. In addition, Hayato Sakamoto brings a hot bat into Saturday's game. The 32-year-old shortstop is batting .389 and leads the team in slugging (.722) and doubles (three). In Japan's 7-6 victory over the Americans on Monday he went 3-for-5 with one run and one RBI. The Americans have a favorable matchup against Morishita. The weakness in Team USA's lineup is striking out (50 strikeouts in 166 at-bats), but Morishita is not a swing-and-miss pitcher. He has just 77 strikeouts in 95.1 innings in his NPB season and struck out just three against Mexico in his only other start at the Olympics. In addition, Triston Casas has been on fire for the United States. A first baseman in the Red Sox organization, Casas leads all Olympians in home runs (three) and RBI (eight) and ranks third in slugging (.789). On Monday against Japan, Casas went 2-for-4 with two runs and three RBI. Snyder has broken down this matchup, and one of his picks is over for the run total. But he has discovered a critical X-factor that has him jumping all over one side of the run line. Head to SportsLine now to see his analysis and expert Olympic baseball picks.

France takes on Serbia on Saturday morning in Tokyo, with a medal on the line. The teams faltered in the semifinals, but the bronze medal is up for grabs, leaving plenty to play for. Both teams have displayed versatility and resilience in the Olympics, with a competitive game likely in the offing. Tip-off is scheduled for 3 a.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists France as a two-point favorite in the latest France vs. Serbia odds. The over-under for total points is set at 142.5. Before finalizing any Serbia vs. France women's basketball picks or predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics rolling on, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Saturday's France vs. Serbia matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Serbia vs. France: France is one of the more efficient shooting teams in the Olympics to this point. The French are burying more than 78 percent of their free-throw attempts and, inside the arc, the French are converting 54.4 percent of their shots. They also have the edge in the passing department, with France averaging more assists (21.6 per game) and fewer turnovers (13.4 per game) than Serbia so far in Tokyo. Defensively, France has caused complete havoc for the opposition at times, including 9.2 steals per game in the tournament. Gabby Williams is the leader in that defensive attack, averaging 3.2 steals per game on her own, and the former top-five WNBA draft pick adds 9.4 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.6 assists per contest. Offensively, Sandrine Gruda is the team's centerpiece, leading the squad with 13.4 points per game on 63 percent shooting, and an impressive 6.2 rebounds per game. France is the more talented team on paper, and it\u00a0can lean on that advantage. As the reigning Eurobasket champions, the Serbian side is not afraid of the moment. The Serbians are incredibly balanced offensively, and there is also star power in play. Sonja Vasic the face of the squad, and she won the Eurobasket MVP to go along with the team's triumph. Vasic is averaging 9.8 points and a team-leading 6.4 rebounds per game in Tokyo, and she is connecting on 45.5 percent of her 3-point attempts. Yvonne Anderson is the team's leading scorer, averaging 12.0 points per game, but five players are averaging at least 6.4 points per contest. All told, a large part of Serbia's effectiveness has come defensively, and it will need to continue that. This is a team known for its grinding approach, and it can clamp down on France, or any opponent, for long stretches of time. Tierney has taken a close look at the Serbia vs. France Olympic basketball matchup from all angles and is leaning under on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball predictions at SportsLine.

France is the challenger, though it is led by several talented NBA players, headlined by Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier. Tip-off is scheduled for 10:30 p.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Team USA Basketball as a 12.5-point favorite in the latest USA vs. France odds. The over-under for total points is set at 175.5.

He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the 2020 Olympic basketball odds and betting trends for France vs. USA: In expected fashion, the United States team has been virtually unguardable throughout the tournament. Team USA is averaging 101.4 points per game while leading the entire field in assists (25.6 per game), assist-to-turnover ratio (2.5), field-goal percentage (50.7 percent) and 3-point percentage (41.0 percent). The Americans are also shooting a blistering 59 percent on 2-point attempts, and they have tough shotmakers all over the roster when the opposing defense responds. Team USA is also facing a French team that has committed the most fouls in the tournament, and the United States is shooting 81 percent at the charity stripe in Tokyo. Individually, Kevin Durant leads the way with 19.0 points per game on elite-level shooting efficiency, and Jayson Tatum adds 14.4 points per game on 42 percent shooting from 3-point range. Jrue Holiday, Bam Adebayo and Draymond Green anchor an elite defense when engaged, and the Americans flashed their incredible upside in turning a deficit into a comfortable lead against Australia. While it cannot match the United States player-for-player, France is a talented and cohesive team. The French have been highly efficient from a shooting standpoint in Tokyo, making 48 percent from the floor, 39 percent from 3-point range and 79 percent from the free-throw line. France is also an excellent rebounding team, including 11.4 offensive rebounds per contest during its Olympic run, and the team is anchored by Gobert. The Utah Jazz center is arguably the best defensive player in the basketball world, and he is also putting up 11.4 points and 9.6 rebounds per game during the tournament. Offensively, France also has intriguing talent, with Evan Fournier averaging 19.2 points per game on efficient shooting and former NBA guard Nando De Colo putting up 13.8 points and 6.0 assists per contest.

The Dominicans are playing in the Olympics for just the second time. In their only other appearance, in 1992, they finished sixth. Meanwhile South Korea won the gold medal the last time that baseball was an Olympic sport, in 2008 in Beijing. First pitch is set for 11 p.m. ET on Friday. South Korea is the -160 favorite (risk $160 to win $100) in the latest South Korea vs. Dominican Republic odds from Caesars Sportsbook while the Dominican Republic is the +140 underdog. The over-under for total runs scored is 8.5. Before finalizing any South Korea vs. Dominican Republic picks, be sure to check out the Olympics predictions and betting advice from CBS Sports baseball guru Matt Snyder. A former player for Indiana University and a member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, Snyder has been a baseball writer with CBS Sports since 2011. CBS Sports' longest-tenured baseball expert combines simple logic learned from his baseball-playing days with an extensive background in analytics. He went 26-18 on MLB picks in the 2020 MLB playoffs, including 8-4 on World Series bets. Now, Snyder has set his sights on Dominican Republic vs. South Korea. You can head to SportsLine to see his picks. Here are the 2020 Olympics baseball odds and betting trends for South Korea vs. Dominican Republic: The defending gold medalists will be getting their second look at Dominican Republic starter Raul Valdes. On Sunday the South Koreans put a lot of traffic on the bases with seven hits and three walks in 5.1 innings against Valdes but managed just one run. Seeing Valdes for the second time in seven days should work to South Korea's advantage. In addition the South Koreans have been getting contributions up and down the lineup. Hyunsoo Kim, who played with the Orioles and Twins in the majors, has been the team's best hitter (.385 average, .731 slugging percentage, two home runs and six RBI). But Hae Min Park is batting .400 (fifth best in the tournament) and has scored a tournament-best six runs, while Ji Hwan Oh is slugging .684 with two home runs and five RBI. The Dominicans have been the best fielding team in the tournament. They have committed just one error over five games and have a fielding percentage of .994. The combination of defense and strong pitching has helped them limit opponents to just 17 runs in Tokyo. In addition the Dominicans have been the stronger pitching team so far in the tournament. They rank second in the field in ERA, at 3.56. By comparison the South Koreans have a 4.50 ERA over six games. Snyder has broken down this matchup, and one of his picks is under for the run total (8.5). But he has discovered a critical X-factor that has him jumping all over one side of the money line.

As a result, it's natural to sometimes become a bit numb to the trope. Nevertheless, every Olympics gives way to a handful of stories that break through to the mainstream and once more help shape our appreciation for how much these elite human beings endure, what they train for to have a chance at glory in their sport and on a global stage once every four (or, in this case, five) years. The Olympics' final weekend in Tokyo brought one of those moments. At these Games, there might not be an athlete embodying a story with a greater combination of sacrifice, courage and long-lasting impact for others than the ever-revered Allyson Felix. The 35-year-old queen of American track is one for the ages. On Friday, Felix ran the women's 400-meter final in 49.46 seconds to capture her first Olympic bronze medal and add to a legendary career. Then, Saturday night at Olympic Stadium, Felix ran the second leg of a loaded women's 4x400 relay team. Everyone on the team had a gold to their name entering the race, including 2021 breakout stars Sydney McLaughlin and Athing Mu, who won their golds earlier in the week. The fourth member, Dalilah Muhammad, won gold in the 400-meter hurdles in 2016 and took silver behind McLaughlin on Wednesday. The U.S. quartet blew the field away. With Mu anchoring the relay, Team USA crossed first in 3:16.85. That gold-winning performance put Felix on an echelon all to her own in Olympic history. With this being her final Olympics, Felix will finish with 11 medals -- the most of any track and field athlete in history. Seven golds, three silvers and a bronze. Her longevity is phenomenal. Track sports are normally not for the aged, yet here is Felix -- who just became the oldest U.S. woman to ever win a gold track medal -- with at least one podium appearance in five consecutive Olympics. That's only been done by two other athletes: Jamaican track stars Merlene Ottey and Veronica Campbell-Brown. For four consecutive Olympics, from 2008-2021, Felix won a gold medal. Unprecedented in American track history. On Friday, in the 400, Felix got it done by running like the exceptional, resilient veteran she is, doing so from all the way out in Lane 9. That's not the spot most sprinters win medals from. But as we've seen for well over a decade: Felix isn't most sprinters. The greatest runner in women's track history held her elongated turn with confident pace and never relented on her speed in the final 50 meters. Not only was it fast enough for a bronze, it was Felix rising to a necessary Olympic level once more in order to find the podium. That 49.46 sprint was Felix's fastest 400 time in six years -- meaning she ran better in Tokyo as a 35-year-old mom than when she took the silver in this event in 2016 at the age of 30. It was, in fact, the second-fastest 400 Felix ran in her life. From Lane 9. Remarkable. Bahamian Shaunae Miller-Uibo won gold (48.36), while Marileidy Paulino, of the Dominican Republic, took silver (49.20). Felix's 11 medals don't just distinguish her in terms of track athletes; she's forever in a special pantheon of all-time greats throughout sports. Friday's bronze tied her with none other than Carl Lewis for the most track and field medals by an American in history, and then Saturday marked the fourth consecutive Olympics that Felix won gold as a member of the women's 4x400 squad. Team USA has won gold in seven straight Olympics in that event. Yet, as recently as a few years ago, almost nobody thought she'd be here. Between her last appearance on an Olympic stage in Rio de Janeiro and now, Felix affected change throughout the world of track and field. She stood up to a multi-billion-dollar corporation. She testified to Congress about inequalities and child mortality rates in the Black community, doing so after overcoming her own serious pregnancy health scare. After the 2016 Games, when Felix won two golds and a silver, she knew it was time: she wanted to start her family. The decision to have a child has affected the careers of countless female track athletes over the decades. For most, it signaled an end to their Olympic aspirations. Felix didn't believe that should have to be her reality -- nor anyone else's going forward, if they didn't want it to be -- and she didn't want the $30 billion corporation sponsoring her, Nike, to think that was the case either. But that's not what happened. In 2018, as Felix was training in secret and avoiding initially revealing her pregnancy to Nike, she was also in negotiations for a new contract. She didn't believe it to be right for Nike to have the power to significantly reduce how much she would be paid in the future based off her performance while pregnant and during her postpartum period. Nike balked. It didn't agree. With motherhood now in Felix's near future, Nike was clear: the company would not be open to continuing to sponsor and pay Felix the same way going forward. Here was an all-time Olympian just two years removed from amassing more Olympic golds than any female track athlete in history, and she was being bullied out of a deal. Nike was prepared to cut the terms of Felix's endorsement by as much as 70%. In light of what Felix has done since, this now amounts to one of the more embarrassing marketing miscalculations of the past decade in all of sports. It was also narrow-minded and discriminatory. The decision obviously angered Felix, who became inspired to speak out, and in doing so, violated the terms of her non-disclosure agreement with the company. It would mean the end of her endorsement deal with the most powerful apparel brand company on the planet.\u00a0She first spoke out in a New York Times op-ed, in a moment of true courage that was in some ways precedent-setting. After all, how often do we see an athlete speak out against a company that endorses them? For Felix, the battle was always bigger than money. It was about making people understand that just because it's women who carry the burden of bearing children, it shouldn't mean women should also have to accept endorsement and earning restrictions based off their performance as mothers or mothers-to-be. Felix left Nike, signed with Athleta, and within months the uproar was so loud that Nike wound up changing its policy regarding female athletes and contractual agreements tied to childbirth. By then it was too late for Nike to keep Felix. Amid all of this, she was forced to have an emergency cesarean section seven months into her pregnancy because of a potentially life-threatening condition brought on by high blood pressure. Her baby daughter, Camryn, had to live for more than a month in the NICU. In late June, after Felix rallied to qualify for the Olympics for a fifth time -- with 2-year-old Camryn on hand to watch -- she posted the photo below to Instagram. Draped in a god's haul of medals, there was also the deliberate artistic decision to include her C-section scar, as it's now a significant part of her story and a mark on her body that represents so much of what she went through over the past three years to get to this point. \"I used my voice and built this company for you. So that you never have to train at 4:30am while you're 5 months pregnant to hide your pregnancy from your sponsor,\" Felix wrote. \"The world doesn't need more shoes, but the world does need to see women wholly and meet them right where they are.\" When Felix crossed the finish line Friday, and when she stepped to the podium to receive her gold on Saturday, she did so wearing her own new shoe, the Saysh One. It was designed by her own company and with a team of women who created the product. What happened this weekend at Olympic Stadium was so much more than a couple of age-defying sprints by the greatest female track star of all time. Friday's 400 took 49.46 seconds to finish, but in reality this is a race that started years ago. Thanks to Allyson Felix, we can actually start to see the finish line.", "list": null, "preprocessed": "olympics provide inspirational story and/or tale sacrifice frequently often feel like

shootout in the final against Sweden. The two teams played to a 1-1 draw in regulation and were unable to break through during two periods of extra time. Stina Blackstenius scored in regulation for Sweden, and Jessie Fleming converted a penalty kick for the equalizer. The two sides both had a strong showing in the first half, as each team spent time in each other's half, though Sweden did far more with their opportunities in the final third. Blackstenius broke the deadlock in the 34th minute, as the Europeans led Canada in total shots (11-3), despite splitting possession at 50%. Canada's opportunity to equalize came way via penalty as Swedish defender Amanda Lestedt made contact on Christine Sinclair inside the box and VAR confirmed the foul. Fleming converted the penalty in the 67th minute, as Canada remained active in front of goal during stoppage time of regulation. Fatigue settled in each during the two halves of extra time, and substitutions nearly made the difference as Deanne Rose and Jordyn Huitema had chances for Canada and Lina Hurtig nearly connected on set pieces for Sweden, but the game headed to penalties to determine the gold medal. Sweden entered the gold medal match unbeaten in their Tokyo campaign and winners of five consecutive matches ahead of the Olympic final. In the build-up to the final, the team did not need penalty kicks to decide any of their knockout stage games. Canada's journey to the gold medal match presented narrow draws, extra-time scenarios, and penalty kicks. As the two Olympic finalists traded makes and misses (both teams missed three consecutive spot kicks at one point), and each keeper made saves. Candian keeper Stephanie Labb\u00e9 made a huge save on Sweden's Andersson, and Julia Grosso converted her attempt to give Canada the Olympic gold for the first time in their history. Sinclair, the all-time leading goal scorer in international soccer, made her exit in the gold medal match during regulation in the 87th minute to make way for Huitema and was unavailable for penalty kick selection.

The contest between the U.S. and France will serve as a rematch, as the two teams also met in the first game of group play last month. In that game, France pulled out a 83-76 win, thanks largely to Evan Fournier, who had a game-high 28 points on 11 of 22 shooting from the floor. Rudy Gobert also added 14 points and nine rebounds of his own. As a team, France shot an impressive 47 percent from the floor. It outscored the U.S. 46-31 in the second half, and went on a16-2 run to close out the game and secure the win. The group stage loss was actually the United States' second straight to France in international play, as the French also prevailed over the U.S. in the 2019 FIBA World Cup. Given the way their last couple of meetings played out, it's safe to say that the Americans will be seeking revenge -- in addition to a gold medal. Falling to France was the only defeat that the U.S. suffered during these Olympics, while the French team has yet to lose a game. Here's everything you need to know about the gold medal game between the United States and France. Date:\u00a0Friday, Aug. 6\u00a0|\u00a0Time:\u00a010:30 p.m. ETLocation:\u00a0Saitama Super Arena -- Saitama, Japan\u00a0TV:\u00a0NBC and Peacock\u00a0|\u00a0Live stream:\u00a0fuboTV (Try for free)Odds:\u00a0USA -900; FRA +600\u00a0|\u00a0O/U:\u00a0175.5 (via William Hill Sportsbook) United States: Team USA has been playing much better basketball since they lost to France at the start of group play, but it will take a full 40-minute effort if the Americans are going to exact their revenge and claim a fourth consecutive gold medal. One obvious adjustment that the U.S. will have to make? They need to do a much better job of defending Fournier, who was the best player on the floor the first two the two teams met. Fournier hit big bucket after big bucket for France, and ultimately his production was a major determining factor in the contest. In all, he finished with a game-high 28 points while shooting 50 percent from the floor (11 of 22). He also knocked down four 3s and grabbed four rebounds. After the game, Fournier\u00a0provided an honest assessment\u00a0of Team USA. \"They are better individually but they can be beaten as a team,\" he said. It will now be up to Team USA to prove Fournier wrong, and limiting his offensive production will help their cause. They'll also have to shoot better than they did in the first game. The U.S. shot just 36 percent from the floor in that contest, compared to 47 percent from France. In a game that was decided by seven points, this made a big difference. France: It's tough to overstate how big of an opportunity the French team has here. France has won a silver medal in Olympic play twice (1948, 2000), but it has never won gold. Now, the only thing standing between the French and their first gold is a team that they've already bested in these very Olympics. Both times the French team has finished with the Silver Medal they lost to the U.S. in the championship game, so in a way they're seeking some revenge of their own. To get it, they'll need big games from Fournier, Gobert, Nic Batum and all of their other key contributors. The U.S. has been playing better basketball as the Olympics have gone on, and as such they're not the same team that dropped their Olympic opener to France late last month. They've found an identity on the defensive end, and their shot making has been there when it's mattered most. The French team is excellent, but at the end of the day the U.S. is the more talented team, and they should be able to take care of business.

The reigning NFL MVP's praise of Biles extended beyond her work on the mat. In an interview with The Ringer, Rodgers credited Biles' ability to speak freely about her mental health and advocate the same for others. \"I give Simone so much credit for her ability to speak the truth, her truth, and to answer tough questions, and to have the courage to say, 'I'm scared' and 'I don't feel like I should be out there,'\" Rodgers said. \"She's the greatest gymnast of all time. And mental health [awareness] is an issue that is continuing to break down the stigmas that don't allow us to talk about it or only allow us to talk about it in a super negative, depressive, suicidal way. \"People of all ages and all professions are dealing with mental issues, especially during COVID... it's something we should be talking about and ways to help people get through it, whether it's techniques or therapy or just conversations letting people know they're not alone. And that's what Simone did. I'm very, very proud of her.\" Biles, who withdrew from four finals for mental health reasons, was seen supporting teammates Suni Lee, MyKala Skinner and Jade Carey throughout their respective runs that ended in winning Olympic hardware. That American group won silver in the team competition, without Biles, preceding the individual events. Athletes, Rodgers claims, have higher platforms to deliver important messages such as mental health advocacy. Biles has spoken extensively on that very subject these Games, doing everything from explaining what the \"twisties\" are to outlining her personal struggles with the yips-like issue. Talking like Biles has is a trend Rodgers, who has \"gotten to know her a little bit at times over the years,\" hopes continues. \"Well, we should keep talking about it,\" Rodgers said. \"Keep talking about ways that we individually deal with stress and deal with anxiety and deal with pressure and deal with depression or loneliness. I think that would really help. Because we, whether we like it or not, have a platform to influence people. \"And our words are often listened to more than the person who's not in the public eye as much.

This was a truly elite defensive performance from the Americans, as they flew around in passing lanes, protected the paint and largely disrupted everything Serbia was trying to do. They held Serbia to just 59 points on 30 shooting from the field, and forced 12 turnovers. If it wasn't for a strong effort on the offensive glass, in which they earned 10 second-chance points, the outcome would have been even worse for Serbia.

Since then, his European soccer picks have been spot-on. Green has generated nearly $19,000 for $100 bettors since the 2017-18 season, and he has his finger on the pulse of the game all over the globe. Now, Green has taken a close look at the Japan vs. Mexico matchup and revealed his Olympics soccer best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see the picks. Here are the Olympic soccer odds and betting trends for Mexico vs. Japan: El Tri played a strong match in the group-stage meeting but couldn't catch up after going down by two goals early. A converted penalty in the 12th minute put Japan up 2-0 in the 12th minute, and a second-half Johan Vazquez red card left Mexico playing with 10 men for more than 20 minutes. El Tri dominated possession, but could not find the goals. It also buckled down to hold a powerful Brazil team without a goal for 120 minutes before falling on penalties. Now it faces a Japan team that could be discouraged not to have a chance at gold in its home event. Both teams have been known for their defense, but the Mexicans have more attacking talent. Midfielder Luis Romo is the engine of the offense, while fellow Mexican Liga MX star Henry Martin is the finisher. Romo had a goal and two assists in a 6-3 win against South Korea in the quarterfinals, while Martin is tied for the team lead with Francisco Cordova after scoring three goals in the five matches. Goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa, Martin's teammate with Liga MX contender Club America, is one of the team's leaders and is a steady presence in the net. The Japanese squad has been organized and efficient, allowing just two goals in the five games. It held Mexico off the score sheet for the first 85 minutes in the July 25 win and did not concede to Spain until late in extra time. The loss to the Spaniards snapped a nine-game unbeaten run that saw Japan yield just three goals while scoring 24. This team is built for defense, with backs Maya Yoshida and Hiroki Sakai joining fierce defensive midfielder Wataru Endo as the three over-age players on the roster. Japan is 7-3-4 in its last three Olympics appearances. Japan also is seeking revenge against Mexico after El Tri ousted it from London 2012 on its way to the gold medal. It will have the entire nation behind it and knows from last month's victory that it can take the bronze medal if it executes the same way. Japan took a 2-0 lead in the first 12 minutes then sat back to defend. Mexico controlled the ball for 62 percent of the match but had just four shots on target. Takefusa Kubo, a 20-year-old prospect who is trying to earn playing time with Real Madrid, scored the first goal. That was the second of his three in the tournament.

Both teams are trying to unseat the heavily favored United States squad, but they must first defeat the other. France defeated Spain in the quarterfinals. Japan knocked off Belgium to advance to this point. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 a.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists France as a three-point favorite in the Japan vs. France odds. The over-under, or total number of points expected, is 149. Before finalizing any France vs. Japan basketball picks or predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics rolling on, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Friday's France vs. Japan matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Japan vs. France: Japan's only loss in the tournament came against the United States and the Japanese are playing with confidence. They knocked off Belgium by a one-point margin and, in the process, reached the Olympic semifinals for the first time. Moreover, Japan isn't shy about its ambition. \"Four and a half years ago, I said my goal, my dream, is to beat America in the Tokyo Olympics in the championship game,\" Japan head coach Thomas Wayne Hovasse told the media after the quarterfinal win. \"Everybody laughed at me. I don't know, there might be some people starting to believe now.\" France has been up-and-down at times during the Olympics, but managed to escape with a narrow defeat over Spain in the quarterfinals. The French played very well down the stretch and, overall, France has played with improved tempo in Tokyo when compared to previous tournaments. Defensively, France is generating havoc on a consistent basis, and that is manifested with 8.8 steals per game, a top-three mark in the tournament. On the offensive end, France is balanced in nature, with four players averaging in double figures. Sandrine Gruda leads the way to this point, averaging 12.5 points per game and shooting 60 percent from the floor. Gruda is also an excellent rebounder, picking up 7.0 caroms per game. Elsewhere, Gabby Williams has been excellent, putting up 10.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and a whopping 3.3 steals per game. Tierney has taken a close look at the Japan vs. France Olympic basketball matchup from all angles and is leaning over on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball predictions at SportsLine.

For the U.S., it is their first gold in women's beach volleyball since the legendary tandem of Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings were the last team standing at the 2012 Games in London. For May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings, that 2012 win was their straight gold medal in the event. This may be the start of a similar stretch for Ross and Klineman. The Americans did not lose a single set in their elimination matches en route to the final, and against the pair of Australians, it was much of the same story. After taking the first set, 21-15, Ross and Klineman went down 2-0 to begin the second frame. Then, they turned it on and went on a 10-1 scoring run to create some distance. The Australians fought back and came to within 20-16 in the second set. But that would be as close as they came, as the Americans scored on match point to win the final. \"It's so tough,\" Ross said. \"It was such a shot in the dark. For us to get here and do this, with this kind of competition just blows my mind. To get a gold medal finally, feels so amazing\" For Ross, 39, it was her third Olympic medal and her first gold. She won silver with Jen Kessy at the 2012 Games and took home a bronze at the 2016 Olympics alongside her partner, the aforementioned Walsh Jennings. The win in Tokyo also makes Ross the oldest women to win a gold at the Olympics in any type of volleyball event.

According to a report by the Houston Chronicle, Owens shared that he had been able to communicate with Biles while she was competing in Tokyo, and did his best to try and keep her positive and motivated while she dealt with the \"twisties\" in addition to other mental stresses that forced her to withdraw from several gymnastics competitions. Owens also stated that he had a sense of what was going on when Biles withdrew from team competition. \"I remember it was early in the morning, and my heart was really  beating because I could see her face, and I kind of know her facial  expressions,\" Owens said. \"I could kind of read her lips and know what was  going on and what she was telling her coach.

He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Serbia vs. USA: Team USA seems to be peaking at the right time. The Americans walloped Australia by a 21-point margin in the quarterfinal and, for the most part, they've made it look easy in Tokyo, even when they didn't have their \"A\" game on full display. No team, including Serbia, can come close to matching Team USA in terms of individual talent and, with every passing day, the potential gap in cohesion when compared to more seasoned teams could be closing. The United States leads the tournament in scoring, assists and field-goal percentage, showcasing its ultimate offensive ceiling. On top of that, Team USA has shown that it is fully capable of locking up defensively at times during the tournament. The Serbians are worthy opponents, but they haven't flashed the offensive ceiling required to take out the United States in a setting that is remotely near the projections. Team USA just has too much firepower for most opponents to contend with, even at the highest levels. Serbia has regularly shown its resilience in this tournament, including a comeback win over China in the quarterfinals. The reigning Eurobasket champions bring a balanced scoring attack to the table but, more than anything, the Serbians done it with defense in Tokyo. They are grinding things out by contesting shots and being tougher than their opponents, with Serbia averaging only 71 points per game and still winning. Sonja Vasic is the team's leader and, in addition to averaging 11.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game in the Olympics, she is the reigning Eurobasket MVP. Jelena Brooks leads the team in scoring at 13.5 points per game in the tournament, and Serbia can also take solace in ball control issues and periods of inconsistency from the high-powered American side.

Thankfully, Great Britain's Hector Pardoe did not have to endure an injury few can stomach, despite his own thoughts. According to a report by Michael Hincks of Eurosport, Pardoe withdrew from men's marathon swimming competition at the Tokyo Olympics after suffering an eye injury he initially feared was the loss of his eyeball. Pardoe suffered a cut above the eye after taking an elbow to the face during the last lap of the open-water, 10km event, and was unable to finish as he sought immediate medical attention. \"I couldn't see anything, I thought my eye had fallen out in the water,\" Pardoe said. \"I  was going up to the lifeguard saying 'My eye! My eye! Is it okay?' They  weren't giving me a very precise opinion, then I had to get out after  that.\" Pardoe had been trying to secure a Top 10 finish when the incident happened, which caused his goggles to fall off his face in addition to the slice above his eye. Pardoe's injury illustrates the high-contact nature of marathon swimming, and came in a race that took place in exceptionally warm water. According to a report by Corrine Heller of Yahoo Sports, temperatures in the Tokyo Bay surpassed 80 degrees Fahrenheit. As for the race itself, defending world champion Florian Wellbrock of Germany dominated the event to earn the gold medal by the largest margin of victory in Olympic marathon swimming history. Wellbrock finished in one hour, 48 minutes, and 33.7 seconds, with a margin of victory of 25.3 seconds over Hungary's Kristof Rasovszky.

With another defeat on their hands, former American track and field star Carl Lewis had some harsh criticism for the United States 4x100-meter relay team. Following the race, Lewis, who won two of his nine Olympic gold medals as a member of the 4x100-meter relay team, took to Twitter and called Team USA's attempt \"a total embarrassment.\" \"The USA team did everything wrong in the men's relay,\" Lewis tweeted. \"The passing system is wrong, athletes running the wrong legs, and it was clear that there was no leadership. It was a total embarrassment, and completely unacceptable for a USA team to look worse than the AAU kids I saw . The United States ended up finishing in sixth place behind the likes of China, Canada, Italy, Germany, and Ghana with a time of 38.10. All five countries in front of the United States qualified for the final. One of the biggest reasons for the poor finish was Trayvon Bromell getting off to a less-than-stellar start in the first leg. In addition, the Americans had a botched baton pass between Fred Kerley and Ronnie Baker, who ran the second and third legs of the race respectively. Baker was forced to slow down completely in order to grab the baton from Kerley. Prior to the botched baton pass, the United States was in the middle of the field. Lewis also took issue with what runners were running what legs of the relay for the United States. It's unclear who exactly Lewis would've had run which leg, but he was clearly frustrated. In the 2008 Olympics, the United States dropped the baton on the last leg in an error between Darvis Patton and Tyson Gay. In 2016, the Americans earned silver medals, but were stripped after Gay tested positive for a banned substance. Four years later, the United States was disqualified when a baton hand-off between Mike Rodgers and Justin Gatlin took place outside of the designated area.

Sweden has won all five while outscoring its opponents 13-3. Canada beat Chile in the Olympics 2020 group stage then beat Brazil in a shootout before converting a late penalty kick to beat the USWNT 1-0 on Monday.

The over-under for total goals scored is set at 1.5. Before making any Canada vs. Sweden picks or 2020 Tokyo Olympic soccer predictions, you have to see what consummate soccer insider Martin Green has to say. After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Since then, his European soccer picks have been spot-on. Green has generated nearly $19,000 for $100 bettors since the 2017-18 season, and he has his finger on the pulse of the game all over the globe. Now, Green has taken a close look at the Sweden vs. Canada matchup and revealed his Olympics soccer best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see the picks. Here are the Olympic soccer odds and betting trends for Canada vs. Sweden: The Swedish team is highly confident and is hungry to win the gold after falling just short in a 2-1 loss to Germany at the 2016 Rio Games. Sweden is on a 15-game unbeaten streak, outscoring its opponents 46-7. It faces a Canada team that was outshot 17-5 and put just two shots on target in the semifinal against Team USA. Canada has scored five goals in its five games and has not put more than two shots on net in any of them. The Canucks will have trouble getting one past veteran Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl, who has appeared in 172 matches. Lindahl is protected by central defenders Magdalena Eriksson and Amanda Ilestedt, who both have more than 50 appearances for the national team. The Swedish attack is prolific, with striker Stina Blackstenius and wingers Fridolina Rolfo and Sofia Jakobsen all dangerous finishers. Blackstenius and Rolfo have combined for seven goals in the tournament, while Lina Hurtig has two off the bench. Captain Caroline Seger and fellow midfielder Kosovare Asllani have combined for 67 international goals, with the 35-year-old Seger's passing and vision driving the offense. The Canucks have displayed amazing resilience throughout the tournament. They also will be on a tremendous high after beating the USWNT for just the fourth time -- and the first time in more than 20 years. Canada has not been lighting up the scoreboard, but it has allowed just three goals in the five matches and just held powerful Brazilian and American teams off the score sheet. A defense powered by veterans Kadeisha Buchanan and Allysha Chapman and relentless midfielder Desiree Scott provides stout protection in front of goalkeeper Stepanie Labbe. Canada also has strong incentive to improve on its bronze-medal finish in 2016 after losing 2-0 to eventual champion Germany in the semifinal. The squad is loaded with experience, with Christine Sinclair, the all-time leader in appearances (301) and goals (187), the driving force. Forwards Nichelle Prince and Janine Beckie have combined for 45 career goals, and Beckie has two of Canada's five goals in the tournament while Sinclair has one. Sweden comes in off a matchup against Australia where it held just 49 percent possession and a 9-8 edge in shots. Green has examined the Sweden vs. Canada match from every angle, and he is leaning under on the goal total (1.5). He also has three confident best bets, including one that pays plus-money, and complete analysis of this Tokyo 2020 final matchup. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine.

The Americans will square off with Japan, the only team to beat them so far, on Saturday for gold. Team USA is looking for its second gold medal in baseball, and the country's first since 2000. The Olympic baseball competition kicked off July 27 with the group stage involving two groups of three teams each. Within those groups, each team will play a round-robin schedule -- i.e., each team in a group plays each of the other two teams in that same group for a total of six games across both groups. Teams are then ranked based on the results of the group stage, and then the knockout stage begins. In the knockout stage, teams play under a double-elimination format. The top two seeds from the group stage in essence get a \"bye\" to the one quarterfinal. Meantime, the two seeds and three seeds will play each other, and the winners of those two games will advance to the other quarterfinal. The losers of those games will go to the loser's bracket and remain in the running for a spot in the semifinals. The winner of each quarterfinal goes to one semifinal, while the other semifinal is populated by the two teams emerging from the loser's bracket. The winner of each quarterfinal meets in the first semifinal game, and the winner of that contest advances to the gold medal game, The loser will be placed in the second semifinal and face a team advancing from the loser's bracket. The winner of that game will advance to the gold medal game, while the loser will play for the bronze medal.

Team USA men's basketball and women's soccer were among the sports that were in action overnight. Thursday will offer another exciting slate of Olympic action, with the likes of men's basketball and women's beach volleyball being among the most anticipated events. Here's a recap of the Day 13 action and a look ahead at what's to come on Thursday. Team USA put together a convincing 7-2 win over Korea and advanced to the gold medal game. New York Yankees prospect Tyler Austin and Boston Red Sox minor leaguer Jack Lopez each recorded a pair of hits and two RBIs to pace the United States offense. The Americans put the game out of reach with a five-run sixth inning, which featured four singles in that frame. Austin recorded a two-run single to extend Team USA's lead to 7-1 and the Americans wouldn't look back. The United States will face host country Japan in the gold medal game on Friday. Meanwhile, Korea will take on the Dominican Republic for the bronze medal. The United States men's basketball team was able to overcome 15-point first half deficit in a 97-78 win over Australia. Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant, who recently became the United States all-time leading Olympic scorer, kept his spectacular play going as he scored 23 points and secured nine rebounds. Durant has now scored at least 23 points in each of the Americans' last three wins. Early on, the United States shot just 2-of-14 from 3 in the first half before completely changing their fortunes. In the second half, the Americans connected on 7-of-14 3-point attempts and were able to close out strong. With the win, the United States will now face France for the gold medal on Friday after their win over Luka Doncic and Slovenia. The United States women's soccer team was able to put its semifinal loss to Canada in the rear view mirror. The Americans defeated Australia 4-3 in the bronze medal game thanks to two goals apiece from Carli Lloyd and Megan Rapinoe. The United States came out of the gate strong as Rapinoe scored the game's opening goal in the eighth minute. After Australia's Sam Kerr knotted the contest up at one in the 17th minute, the Americans responded with three consecutive goals. Australia did add a pair of goals in the second half, but the United States was able to hold on in what could be the final Olympic match of several of the team's veteran stars. Team USA's Ryan Crouser etched his name in the history books during the men's shot put final Crouser won the gold medal in the event while also setting an Olympic record in five of his six attempts. The American shot put star recorded a final throw of 23.30 meters, which just fell short of his world record of 23.37. Crouser had previously won a gold medal in the event at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and became just the fourth man ever to win a shot put gold medal twice.

Since Doncic's entered the NBA we've seen this scenario countless times, and it usually means we're in for a dazzling finish by the 22-year-old guard. But as France sent a double team to Doncic out of a screen, he shoveled off the pass to teammate Klemen Prepelic who attacked the rim and had France's Nicolas Batum on his hip with what appeared to be a clear path to the rim. However, just when Prepelic thought he had the game-winning bucket, Batum delivered a perfectly-timed block off the glass to end the game and crush Slovenia's dreams of playing for a gold medal. It's a tough blow for Slovenia, who will now face Australia in the bronze medal game. But it was also a tremendous play by Batum, who put his stamp on the game after finishing with four blocks, five rebounds, three points and three assists. The French team was led by newly-signed New York Knicks player Evan Fournier, who fouled out of the game in the final few possessions after putting up 23 points, five rebounds and three assists. After Fournier fouled out, it appeared as though the momentum shifted in Slovenia's favor, as Prepelic knocked down a 3-pointer to bring the game to within one point, and a missed shot by France's Nando De Colo gave Slovenia the chance to win the game. But Batum had other ideas, and his block preserved a win for a France team that will now face the United States for the second time in this tournament. The first time these two teams faced each other at the start of the Olympics, France delivered a stunner to the Americans, en route to undefeated group play. The stakes are higher this time around, and Team USA will be heavily motivated by that loss to ensure it doesn't happen again, but France has been playing like a well-oiled machine throughout the entire tournament. Fournier's looked like a superstar with France, (19 points per game, 41.7 percent from 3-point territory), and with a roster comprised of five NBA players that also includes All-Star Rudy center Gobert and Batum, France has the second most talent of any team in the Olympics.

Thursday night in Tokyo, USA defeated Korea in convincing fashion (USA 7, KOR 2) to advance to the gold medal game in baseball, where they will face Japan. Korea will play the Dominican Republic in the bronze medal game Friday. Although the final score is lopsided, Thursday's game was competitive into the middle innings. USA scratched across runs in the third and fifth innings thanks in part to a solo home run from former Diamondbacks and Brewers minor leaguer Jamie Westbrook. Korea answered back with a run in the top of the sixth to cut their deficit to 2-1. Team USA pulled away with a five-run bottom of the sixth. Longtime big leaguer Todd Frazier opened the inning with a 12-pitch walk, then USA went strikeout, single, one-run single, walk, one-run single, run-scoring ground out, two-run single to plate five runs. Former Yankees prospect Tyler Austin capped the rally with the two-run single to give USA a 7-1 lead. Austin and Red Sox minor leaguer Jack L\u00f3pez each had two hits and drove in two runs. Austin has been USA's best hitter in the tournament, taking a .412 batting average into Thursday's game. He currently plays for the Yokohama BayStars in Japan and the Olympic baseball games are played at his home ballpark, Yokohoma Baseball Stadium. Righty Joe Ryan, who went from the Rays to the Twins in the Nelson Cruz trade, started on the mound and limited Korea to one run in 4 1/3 innings. Fellow righty Ryder Ryan (no relation to Joe) coaxed a double play to end the fifth inning, then tossed a 1-2-3 sixth inning as well. He faced four batters and got five outs, and gave the offense a chance to break the game open. Team USA will face Japan in the gold medal game Saturday. The two teams met earlier this week, with Japan earning a thrilling 7-6 walk-off win in 10 innings. That pushed USA into the loser's bracket of the double-elimination tournament. Longtime Yankees pitcher Masahiro Tanaka is expected to start the gold medal game for Japan. With Thursday's win, former Marlins infielder Eddy Alvarez\u00a0became the third American and only the sixth person ever to win a medal at both the winter and summer Olympics. Alvarez, a speed skater, won a silver medal in the 5,000-meter relay in 2014. He's now guaranteed at least a silver medal in baseball. USA is trying for their second ever Olympic gold in baseball. They beat a heavily favored Cuba team in 2000 thanks to former Brewers pitcher Ben Sheets, who tossed a four-hit shutout in the gold medal game. Japan won the baseball silver medal in 1996.

Although it will not make up for the lack of a gold, both sides will be keen to ensure that they do not go home empty handed. Here is how you can watch the match and what to know: Japan:\u00a0Hajime Moriyasu's men can still make history despite their semifinal disappointment as victory against Mexico will secure their first-ever soccer Olympic medal. The core of this team is young enough to use the experience of the past few weeks in future international tournaments and a bronze medal would be something to show for their progress made. They will have to continue their stalwart defensive performances and hope they can stymie Mexico the way that Brazil did. In the group stage Japan prevailed 2-1, scoring late goal thanks to a 68th minute red card to Mexico's Johan Vasquez. Mexico:\u00a0Jaime Lozano and his side can add to the gold medal from almost 10 years ago and while Bronze might not compare with that success, it is another medal all the same. The Japanese won their last meeting in Group A and El Tri will want to put that right and deny the home nation their first medal. Mexico had been a prolific goal scoring side until they ran into Brazil. The question is will they be able to return to their high flying ways, or will a Japan once again stymie them.

France faces Slovenia on Thursday morning, with a berth in the gold medal matchup on the line. Luka Doncic continues to shine for Slovenia, scoring 26.3 points per game at the 2020 Olympics. France is also led by high-end players, including Rudy Gobert, a three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Tip-off is set for 7 a.m. ET. Slovenia is a 2.5-point favorite in the latest France vs. Slovenia odds from Caesars Sportsbook. The over-under for total points is set at 174.5. Before locking in any France vs. Slovenia basketball picks or Tokyo 2020 predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics well underway, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Thursday's France vs. Slovenia matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for France vs. Slovenia: France is unbeaten in Tokyo, winning by an average of 13.3 points per game. While Slovenia has Doncic, the French are the deeper, more talented team from top to bottom. Gobert provides uber-elite rim protection as the world's best defensive center, and he is surrounded by other NBA talent. Gobert is averaging 12 points and eight rebounds per game despite playing only 24 minutes, and Evan Fournier is putting up 18.3 points per game. Fournier recently agreed to a massive contract with the New York Knicks, and France also has Nic Batum and Nando De Colo to round out their top-flight rotation. France is No. 2 in field goal percentage (50.0 percent) during the Olympics, and the French should be the better defensive team in this matchup. Furthermore, the French can game plan for Doncic and make the rest of Slovenia's supporting cast beat them. Slovenia has been fantastic in the tournament, and a lot of that can be traced to Doncic. The Dallas Mavericks star is an All-NBA player, and he is currently the frontrunner for MVP honors in Tokyo. Doncic leads the tournament in scoring, averaging 26.3 points per game, and he is shooting 52.2 percent from the floor. On top of his efficient shot creation, Doncic is No. 2 in the Olympics in both rebounding (10.0 per game) and assists (8.0 per game). He has been utterly dominant and, as a result, Slovenia's offense is cooking at a high level. The Slovenes are leading the tournament in scoring at 105.8 points per game and Slovenia is shooting 49.8 percent as a team. France is deeper with NBA talent, but Slovenia has the best player on the floor and that is often an x-factor. Tierney has taken a close look at the France vs. Slovenia semifinal showdown from all angles and is leaning under on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the France vs. Slovenia spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball predictions at SportsLine.

This is the first ever bronze medal match for the United States, and a win for Australia would be their first ever Olympic medal for the women's soccer program. The match is the second meeting between the two teams during the Tokyo Games after playing each other to a scoreless draw in Group G play. Here's how you can watch the match and what to know: USWNT:\u00a0The team is coming off its first loss against Canada in a major tournament and will now compete for bronze against Australia. The Americans will be without their starting goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher (knee injury), but Adrianna Franch has the confidence of her teammates and is a top talent between the posts. Last time these two teams met, head coach Vlatko Andonovski tasked his team with executing a draw as the two teams played out to a scoreless tie. The USWNT attack has been virtually non-existent during the Olympic tournament sans a 6-1 win over New Zealand where they recorded four goals. The squad has one final match to close out their Olympics on an offensive high and they will want to attack the wings with Ellie Carpenter out this match for Australia. Australia:\u00a0The Matildas enter the bronze medal game off a semifinal loss against Sweden. The team has been flying high under captain and star striker Sam Kerr, but will have key figure missing on the back line in Carpenter. Head coach Tony Gustavsson, a former USWNT assistant coach, will have to make adjustments in her absence as Carpenter's presence has allowed the team to play in a steady three back throughout the tournament.

Here are the Olympics soccer odds and betting trends for Australia vs. USWNT: The Americans will be able to go all-out after taking a defensive approach in the previous matchup with Australia. The USWNT's 3-0 loss to the Swedes made it critical to get at least a draw with the Matildas in the group stage, so they sat back and defended. The team put its hopes on a stout defense led by Becky Sauerbrun and Tierna Davidson and stellar two-way players Crystal Dunn and Kelley O'Hara. The Aussies held 65 percent possession, but the USA had a 4-3 edge in shots on target. The Matildas have beaten the USA just once in 29 meetings (1-4-24). Despite the lackluster performances, the USWNT has a ton of experience and talent. Mainstays Carli Lloyd, Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe have combined for 297 career goals, while Tobin Heath and Christen Press also can create big moments. The Americans just couldn't find the net Monday against Canada, despite dominating with 56 percent possession and a 17-5 edge in shots. The Aussies should still be confident despite the 1-0 loss to Sweden, which was the runner-up to Germany at Rio 2016 and thumped Team USA in the group stage. The Matildas won a thrilling game with Great Britain in the quarterfinals, with striker Sam Kerr scoring two more goals to give her five in the tournament. The Aussies also should open things up a bit more in the bronze-medal match. They face a USA defense that has yielded six goals in five games and will be without veteran goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher, who injured her knee in the loss to Canada. Kerr is among the best strikers in the world and is the top all-time scorer in the NWSL. She had 77 goals in 119 matches over seven seasons before leaving for Chelsea ahead the 2020 season. Team USA has been showing its age in this tournament, and the 27-year-old Kerr and the Maltidas should be able to exploit that. The Americans have five forwards and two defenders 32 or older, while the Aussies have just two outfield players over 31. Green has examined the Australia vs. USWNT match from every angle, and he is leaning over on the goal total (2.5). He also has two confident best bets and complete analysis of this Tokyo 2020 matchup. He's only sharing his expert Olympics soccer picks at SportsLine.

The United States faces Australia in the men's semifinals at the 2020 Summer Olympics. Team USA looks to stay alive in the hunt for their fourth straight gold medal. Australia, meanwhile, aims to play spoiler with an impressive run to this point in the tournament. Tip-off is set for 12:15 a.m. ET. Team USA is a 12-point favorite in the latest USA vs. Australia odds from Caesars Sportsbook. The over-under for total points is set at 181. Before locking in any Australia vs. USA basketball picks or Tokyo 2020 predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics underway, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Thursday's Team USA vs. Australia matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Australia vs. USA: Team USA's skill level is simply off the charts. The Americans have been incredibly efficient on the way to 102.5 points per game, shooting 50.5 percent from the floor and 42.8 percent from 3-point distance. Team USA is also leading the field in assists, averaging 27.3 per game, and they are limiting opponents to only nine takeaways per game. Kevin Durant is the face of the squad, averaging 18 points per night on elite efficiency, but he is flanked by elite shot creators like Damian Lillard and Jayson Tatum. The American side also has incredible defensive talent when they turn it on, with Draymond Green and Bam Adebayo impacting the opposition. As a team, the Americans lead the field in blocks (5.0 per game) and they are No. 2 in steals (10.0 per game). When combining their athleticism and explosiveness with the offensive craft, it is easy to see why Team USA should find their footing, even against a quality opponent in Australia. Australia has been highly impressive in Tokyo, and they also defeated the United States in an exhibition matchup before heading to Japan. Patty Mills has been truly excellent in the backcourt for Australia, averaging 20.3 points and 5.3 assists per game while connecting on more than 41 percent of his 3-pointers. Jock Landale lends an inside presence with 13 points per game on strong efficiency, and Australia can cause havoc defensively. Philadelphia 76ers defensive ace Matisse Thybulle leads the entire tournament in averaging 3.3 steals per game, and Australia is generating 10 steals per contest as a team. They are also excellent in a few key areas offensively, with 25.5 assists per game (No. 2 in the field) and an 82.1 percent shooting clip at the free throw line. Australia isn't as talented as the United States, but the Aussies have NBA players and they are a cohesive unit. Tierney has taken a close look at the USA vs. Australia Olympic basketball matchup from all angles and is leaning under on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the Team USA vs. Australia spread. He's only sharing his top Team USA Basketball picks and Olympics 2020 predictions at SportsLine. So who wins USA vs. Australia? And which side of the Australia vs. USA spread is a must-back?

History is on the United States' side as it's 8-0 all-time vs. Australia in the Olympics, and won each time by double digits. Australia, ranked No. 3 in the world, has never won a medal in Olympic men's basketball. It rosters several NBA players, including Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Matthew Dellavedova, Dante Exum and Matisse Thybulle. While the Aussies never beat the Americans in Olympic play, they did prevail in an exhibition game in Las Vegas. They also beat the U.S. in a game played in Melbourne ahead of the 2019 FIBA World Cup. Gregg Popovich is 1-2 vs Australia as Team USA's head coach -- all exhibition games.

But now they'll face an Australia team that beat them in an exhibition game leading up to the Olympics, so the pressure will be on Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard and the rest of Team USA to prove that loss was just a blip on the radar. If they win, either France or Slovenia will match up against them in the championship game. If they lose, then not only will they be playing for a bronze medal, but the criticism that was heaped on them after losing to France will only come more furiously than before. Australia:\u00a0The Aussies haven't dropped a game the entire tournament, and hope to keep that going against a Team USA who will be heavily favored Thursday morning. But the Australian team is a well-oiled machine, and while the Americans have more talent, Australia is a more cohesive team that has experience playing on the international stage prior to the Olympics. In the exhibition game between these two teams, Patty Mills led the Australians with 22 points and four assists, while Joe Ingles tacked on another 17 points in the win. Those two have been the steady force behind this team's success all tournament long, and it will be tested against Team USA. The Americans will want to get some revenge on an Australian team that forced them to answer some hard questions about this team. I think it's close, similar to the game against Spain, but I think eventually Team USA will come out on top and quiet some doubters.\u00a0Pick:\u00a0United States -700, Australia +12", "list": null, "preprocessed": "drop olympic opener team usa rattle three straight victory advance gold medal game win australia semifinal early thursday morning 12:15 a.m. et winner take either france slovenia face semifinal matchup later thursday morning 7 a.m. et history united states side 8 0 time vs. australia olympic time double digit australia rank 3 world never medal olympic man basketball roster several nba player include patty mill joe ingle matthew dellavedova dante exum matisse thybulle aussie never beat americans olympic play prevail exhibition game las vegas also beat u.s game play melbourne ahead 2019 fiba world cup gregg popovich 1 2 vs australia team usa head coach exhibition game ahead semifinal matchup everything need know date \u00a0 thursday aug 5 \u00a0 time \u00a0 12:15 a.m. etlocation \u00a0 saitama super arena saitama japan \u00a0 tv \u00a0 none \u00a0 live stream \u00a0 peacock \u00a0 odd via caesar sportsbook \u00a0 usa -700 australia +475 \u00a0 \u00a0 spread \u00a0 usa -12 \u00a0 \u00a0 u \u00a0 181 team usa \u00a0 americans outlast spain get step close gold medal despite early misstep u.s look far well lose france olympic opener face australia team beat exhibition game lead olympic pressure kevin durant damian lillard rest team usa prove loss blip radar win either france slovenia match championship game lose play bronze medal criticism heap lose france come furiously australia \u00a0 aussie drop game entire tournament hope keep go team usa heavily favor thursday morning australian team well oil machine americans talent australia cohesive team experience play international stage prior olympic exhibition game two team patty mill lead australian 22 point four assist joe ingle tack another 17 point win two steady force behind team success tournament long test team usa americans want get revenge australian team force answer hard question team think close similar game spain think eventually team usa come top quiet doubter \u00a0 pick \u00a0 united states -700 australia +12"}, {"link": "https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/2020-tokyo-olympics-equestrian-riders-claim-sumo-wrestler-statue-may-be-frightening-their-horses/", "title": "2020 Tokyo Olympics: Equestrian riders claim sumo wrestler statue may be frightening their horses", "subtitle": "The statue of an Osumosan allegedly disturbs horses, causing trouble in equestrian qualifiers.", "author": "Steven Taranto", "date": "8/4/2021", "time": "22:36", "section": null, "body": "One of the most important parts of an equestrian's job is to ensure that his or her horse maintains its composure and does not become frightened or panic in a given situation. Some riders say this has become a challenge at the Tokyo Olympics, as one of Japan's cultural staples has left several horses seemingly spooked. According to a report by Jake Seiner of the Associated Press, several riders in equestrian competition at the Olympics believe that a life-size sumo wrestler statue placed next to the tenth obstacle of the Olympic course in Kamiyoga may have distracted several horses in Tuesday night's qualifying session for the individual jumping finals. Several pairings pulled up short of the barrier in that section of the course, in some cases affecting which qualified for the finals and which did not. The Olympic equestrian course features several decorations to hurdles that feature distinctly Japanese features, such as a kimono, items from the Tanabata festival, and a miniature palace resembling those seen in the Heian and Sengoku eras. However, horses seem particularly disturbed by the sumo wrestler, which faces away from approaching riders and greets horse and rider with the wedgie created by their mawashi (loincloth). \"As you come around, you see a big guy's (butt),\"  Harry Charles of Great Britain said. \"... I did notice four or five horses really taking a spook to that.\" While there were some competing theories as to why horses were having trouble in that section of the course -- others suggested that the stadium lights or the nearby sakura (cherry blossoms) may be the culprit -- there were some efforts made to ensure that the horses were not alarmed by the rikishi replica. After seeing other riders have issues, both Terry Vlock of Israel and Darragh Kenny of Ireland made a point to take their horses to the 10th jump prior to their runs so the animal could become familiar with it instead of frightened. \"It does look like a person, and that's a little spooky,\" Vlock said. \"You know,  horses don't want to see a guy, like, looking intense next to a jump,  looking like he's ready to fight you.\" Sumo is one of the most distinctly Japanese sports in all the world, as it is practiced exclusively in Japan and has roots dating back to prehistoric times. Sumo traces its origins to Shinotism, as it was a means of praying for a good harvest and honoring the kami (Gods and/or spirits) of the nation.", "list": null, "preprocessed": "one important part equestrian job ensure horse maintain composure become frightened panic give situation rider say become challenge tokyo olympics one japan cultural staple leave several horse seemingly spook accord report jake seiner associated press several rider equestrian competition olympics believe life size sumo wrestler statue place next tenth obstacle olympic course kamiyoga may distract several horse tuesday night qualifying session individual jumping final several pairing pull short barrier section course case affect qualified final olympic equestrian course feature several decoration hurdle feature distinctly japanese feature kimono item tanabata festival miniature palace resemble see heian sengoku era however horse seem particularly disturb sumo wrestler face away approach rider greet horse rider wedgie create mawashi loincloth come around see big guy butt   harry charles great britain say notice four five horse really take spook compete theory horse trouble section course other suggest stadium light nearby sakura cherry blossom may culprit effort make ensure horse alarm rikishi replica see rider issue terry vlock israel darragh kenny ireland make point take horse 10th jump prior run animal could become familiar instead frightened look like person little spooky vlock say know   horse want see guy like look intense next jump   look like ready fight sumo one distinctly japanese sport world practice exclusively japan root date back prehistoric time sumo trace origin shinotism means pray good harvest honor kami god and/or spirit nation"}, {"link": "https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/tokyo-olympics-2020-baseball-semifinal-odds-predictions-usa-vs-south-korea-picks-from-proven-expert/", "title": "Tokyo Olympics 2020 baseball semifinal odds, predictions: USA vs. South Korea picks from proven expert", "subtitle": "Baseball expert Matt Snyder, who went 26-18 in the 2020 MLB playoffs, just released his picks for the semifinal between USA and South Korea on Thursday", "author": "CBS Sports Staff", "date": "8/4/2021", "time": "21:49", "section": ["Why you should back the United States", "Why you should back South Korea", "How to make 2020 Tokyo Olympics baseball picks for South Korea vs. USA"], "body": "A spot in baseball's gold medal game of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics will be at stake when the United States and South Korea collide in a semifinal on Thursday at Yokohama Baseball Stadium.

A former player for Indiana University and a member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, Snyder has been a baseball writer with CBS Sports since 2011. CBS Sports' longest-tenured baseball expert combines simple logic learned from his baseball-playing days with an extensive background in analytics. He went 26-18 in the 2020 MLB playoffs, including 8-4 on World Series bets. Anybody who followed him saw some huge returns. Now, Snyder has studied the USA vs. South Korea baseball matchup and revealed his expert picks and predictions. You can see his top 2020 Olympics picks only at SportsLine. Here are the latest Olympics baseball odds and betting trends for South Korea vs. USA: Team USA has shown to have the best pitching so far in Yokohama. The Americans lead the six-team Olympics field with a 2.48 ERA. For comparison, the Dominican Republic is second at 3.56. On Thursday, the United States will start Twins Triple-A right-hander Joe Ryan (1-0), who allowed one run and five hits in six innings with three strikeouts in the team's opening game of the Olympics, an 8-1 win over Israel. In addition, Tyler Austin brings a hot bat into Thursday's semifinal. A former Yankee playing in his second season with the Central League's Yokohama DeNA BayStars, Austin is batting .412, with two home runs and five RBI in the tournament. The South Koreans have been the best hitting team so far at the Olympics. Through five games, they are hitting .306 and slugging .468. Both are tops in the field. Hyunsoo Kim, who played with the Orioles and Twins in the majors, has been the team's best hitter, batting .455 with two home runs, six RBI and an .864 slugging percentage. In addition, South Korea has been the better fielding team in Yokohama. The South Koreans have made just two errors through five games and have a fielding percentage of .987. Meanwhile, the Americans have made five errors over four games and have a fielding percentage of .966, worst among the teams at the Summer Olympics.

They were tested in the quarterfinals, but advanced with a 21-19, 21-19 victory over Germany's Margareta Kozuch and Laura Ludwig. Verge-Depre and Heidrich were not even Switzerland's top team, but have been impressive in their march to the semis, including a 21-19, 18-21, 15-12 win over Brazil's Rebecca Cavalcanti Barbosa Silva and Ana Patricia Ramos in the quarterfinals. First serve is set for 8 p.m. ET. Klineman and Ross are listed as the -275 (risk $275 to win $100) favorite in the latest 2020 Tokyo Olympic women's beach volleyball odds from Caesars Sportsbook, while Heidrich and Verge-Depre are the +200 underdogs. Before you make any 2020 Olympics bets or Tokyo 2020 predictions,\u00a0make sure you check out what SportsLine Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. For Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet Over on Team USA's gold-medal count (41.5) and Over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning Under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, Tierney has analyzed Wednesday's women's beach volleyball semifinal from every angle to help bettors cash in at the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics. You can only see Tierney's expert Olympic beach volleyball picks at SportsLine. Ross has already won a pair of Olympic medals and is looking to add to her haul. She paired with Jennifer Kessy to win silver at the 2012 London Olympics, and partnered with Kerri Walsh to take bronze at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Her success has continued with Klineman, when the two paired up at the end of 2017. They had a very successful 2019, taking silver at the Beach Volleyball World Championships. In July, they won the Association of Volleyball Professionals Hydro Cup, as well as the Wilson Cup, before winning the AVP Champions Cup a month later. Klineman, an imposing presence at 6-foot-5, is a four-time All-American with the indoor team at Stanford and transitioned to beach volleyball in 2017. She was a collegiate standout at Stanford and was named the 2010 Volleyball Magazine Player of the Year as a senior. She and Ross won the first tournament they played together in January 2018 and were named the AVP Team of the Year that season. Like Ross and Klineman, Verge-Depre and Heidrich have been teammates for a long time. Verge-Depre is a veteran of the Olympics, having competed in the 2016 Rio Summer Games, placing ninth with teammate Isabelle Forrer. She and Forrer later took bronze at the 2016 FIVB World Tour Finals, before Forrer announced her retirement at the end of that year. Verge-Depre then partnered with Heidrich. Heidrich also competed in the 2016 Summer Olympics with teammate Nadine Zumkehr. As the 14th seed, they took top-seeded Brazil's Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca to three sets, losing 21-23, 27-25, 15-13. Later that year, Zumkehr announced her retirement. At the start of 2017, Heidrich teamed up with Verge-Depre, and the pair have gone on to win one gold and two silver medals at the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour. Tierney has broken down this matchup and has isolated a critical x-factor that has him jumping all over one side of the money line.\u00a0Head to SportsLine now to see Tierney's 2020 Olympics picks.

The main Springsteen failed to qualify is that her horse, Don Juan van de Donkehove, began to have issues during the later stages of the 14-jump course.

The 29-year old will participate in a jumping event as a member of Team USA's four-rider team on Friday.

China has seven more gold medals with a grand tally of 32, but the Americans are trying to catch up. Gold-medal performances from track athletes Athing Mu and Sydney McLaughlin were encouraging earlier this week. There will be additional opportunities for Team USA to grace the medal podium in the near future, as well, with the traditionally-dominant USWNT looking to save face on Thursday against a formidable foe in Australia. With a win the USWNT can avoid missing out on hardware for the second-straight Olympic Games. Kickoff for USWNT vs. Australia from Kashima Stadium is set for 4 a.m ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists the USWNT as -137 on the 90-minute money line, while the Aussies are +375 after refusing to give up three points to the United States during the group stage. Can the USWNT salvage its underwhelming performance with a bronze medal in the third-place game? That remains to be seen. Before locking in any 2020 Tokyo Olympics picks or predictions for those events or others, you need to see what SportsLine Olympics expert Mike Tierney is saying. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. In the past two Olympic Games, his advice helped those who followed him cash in big, and he already has nailed a huge winner at Tokyo 2020. Tierney kicked off his Olympics 2020 picks by taking Norway's Kristian Blummenfelt (+600) as his pick to win gold in Sunday's men's triathlon, and the 27-year-old ran away with the event. He also picked Chinese legend Long Ma (+163) to win the men's table tennis final over ITTF world No. 1 Fan Zhendong and called Japan (+100), upsetting Team USA in the softball final. At the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in 2018, he nailed Suzanne Schulting (+2500) of the Netherlands and Norway's Havard Lorentzen (+800) to triumph in speed skating and the USA's Mikaela Shiffrin (+185) to win the giant slalom. Tierney also took the under (10.5) on the Americans' gold-medal count, and that also cashed as the USA came in with nine. And at the Rio 2016 Summer Games, Tierney told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. Anyone who followed Tierney's advice cashed in huge. Now, Tierney has been studying the 2020 Tokyo Olympics event schedule and digging down into individual and team sports. He has released three confident Olympic best bets for Wednesday and Thursday. He's only sharing his expert Olympics 2020 picks at SportsLine. One giveaway: Tierney is backing Australia to beat the USWNT in regulation at +375 odds. During the group stage, the Matildas tied the Americans in a goalless draw and commanded more than 60 percent of the possession in a dominant performance. The USWNT has had its goalkeeper scratched with an injury, and its uninspired, aging roster could lack motivation playing in a game that's not for first place in the tournament. Australia's Sam Kerr has been exceptional with five goals and one assist. The USWNT hasn't had a consistent player who can match her attacking prowess. The Americans could rally to steal the hardware from Australia, but that seems unlikely given how they've played so far at Tokyo 2020. In addition to backing Australia on the money line against the USWNT on Thursday, Tierney has locked in two other expert best bets for Wednesday. Both picks offer plus-money payouts. He's only giving those 2020 Tokyo Olympics picks away at SportsLine. What are the best bets you can make for Wednesday and Thursday Olympic action?

In addition, Great Britain's Sky Brown, who is just 13, won the bronze medal for her performance in the final. By reaching the podium, Hiraki and Brown have become the youngest Olympic medalists since 1936. If either Hiraki or Brown would've won the gold medal, they would've been the youngest gold medalists in the history of the Games. In Brown's case, she became Great Britain's youngest medalist in Olympic history. \"Skateboarding is a very beautiful sport. There's no rules in skateboarding,\" Brown said following the competition, according to NPR. \"I think more people are gonna start skating now.\" Yosozumi told reporters that there aren't many skateparks throughout Japan -- so few, in fact, that her family had to build one at her house in which she could practice on. While the medalists' ages were quite impressive, the sportsmanship between the competitors was a big story, too.

Now, Team USA's drought on golds in those events will extend to an unthinkable 20 years by the 2024 Paris Games", "author": "Matt Norlander", "date": "8/4/2021", "time": "15:13", "section": null, "body": "Remember this charming moment from the Rio Olympics in 2016? That was Usain Bolt's final go at the Games. He'd crested past his peak by that point, but the iconic 6-foot-5 Jamaican sprinter was still the greatest in the world. For an unprecedented third consecutive Olympics, Bolt won gold in the 100- and 200-meter dashes. It was the semifinal heat of the 200 that produced the cheeky moment above. Who's the other guy? Only one of the greatest sprinters in history, Canadian Andre De Grasse. But then again, when you're running next to Bolt, you're forever shrouded by his shadow. As of Wednesday, De Grasse, 26, is overlooked no more. He emerged into the spotlight in Tokyo and blazed to a Canadian-record 200 time of 19.62 to win the men's final in upset fashion. No, it would not be reigning world champion, American Noah Lyles, who crossed first. And it wouldn't be 17-year-old phenom Erriyon Knighton, from Tampa, either. De Grasse's sprint was good for No. 8 all time in the event. He sprinted .06 of a second ahead of American Kenny Bednarek, who won silver with a personal-best of 19.68. Lyles, running from a slightly disadvantageous Lane 3, crossed in 19.74 to take bronze. Knighton, who was easily coasting past competitors in his opening two heats, somewhat surprisingly did not find the podium. His 19.93 run placed him fourth. Chalk it up to inexperience. Knighton's been running competitively for less than three years. He'll have superstar potential by the time we get to the Paris Games in 2024. For Lyles, it's a medal, sure, but it's also undeniably a letdown. He may have inadvertently done himself in when, on Tuesday, he eased up far too much in the final 15 meters of the 200 semi. Upon doing so, Lyles was caught just barely by Canada's Aaron Brown and Liberia's Joseph Fahnbulleh. It was a needless mistake. Because he was third in that semifinal by a thousandth of a second, Lyles' position for Wednesday's final nudged him from his preferred position: Lane 4. As a result, Lyles pushed harder on the turn than normal. In a few seconds' time, it was clear he couldn't close with his typical finishing speed -- his signature attribute in the 200. With De Grasse running the best race of his life, it meant the favored United States triad of Bednarek, Lyles and Knighton would finish 2-3-4. De Grasse's win gives him two medals at these Games; he also took bronze earlier in the week in the 100-meter dash. A big moment for Canada, which usually saves its biggest Olympic showings in the winter. He's now one of just seven men in history to win at least two Olympics medals in the 200, and is one of only three people ever to win at least four Olympics medals combined in the 100 and 200, with at least one of those medals gold. The other two are Bolt and Carl Lewis. Phenomenal company. And while we continue to champion winning silver and bronze medals, it can also be true that not winning a gold can reflect disappointment and underperformance. That's exactly what happened to the United States on Wednesday. In B.B (Before Bolt) times, the 100 and 200 were events American men effectively dominated. From 1984-2004, the U.S. men won nine out of the available 12 golds in the 100 and 200. Now, Team USA's drought on golds on the men's side in the 100 and 200 will extend to an unthinkable 20 years by the time we get to Paris in 2024. Most of that is because of Bolt, of course, who took the top spots in 2008, 2012 and 2016. Wednesday's race was a plot twist, though. This was Lyles' to lose, and lose he did. Bednarek ran brilliantly; to finish with a silver and a personal-best is a great feat. It's Knighton who's the most interesting. At 17, he is the youngest American male to qualify for the Summer Games since 1964. He was projected to earn a medal due to his freakishly good running earlier this year. After all, this is a young man who now holds the world records in the 200 in the under-18 and under-20 categories. Those records were previously held by Bolt. Nothing matches the pressure and intensity of a race final on an Olympic stage, though. For Knighton to take fourth was both a great run and a surprise, because his potential is so tantalizing. Let's keep in mind: he has not graduated high school yet. Still, it's a bit ironic that at these Tokyo Games, where the United States is again throttling the competition in track and field (as of this publishing, it has 16 medals; Poland is second with six), the American men failed to take first in the 100 and 200.

The Americans got through the first of a three-round sprint on Monday, defeating Spain, the second-ranked team in the world, in the quarterfinals. Next up is Australia in the first semifinal -- set for Thursday morning (late Wednesday night, for all intents and purposes, in the United States) at 12:15 a.m. ET. If the Americans pass that test, they'll be on to the gold medal game, where they would face either France, which beat them less than a week ago in their group-stage opener, or Slovenia, which employs a rather good player by the name of Luka Doncic. It won't be easy for either Doncic or Team USA to advance to the final. Australia went 4-0 through its group stage and has beaten the U.S. the last two times they've faced off (2019 World Cup exhibition, 2021 Olympic exhibition), while France, in addition to beating the U.S., also went 4-0 in group play and probably has a better top-to-bottom roster than Slovenia. But who's betting against Doncic right now? He's 17-0 in his FIBA career, and he's led Slovenia, which came into the Olympics as the 16th-ranked team in the world (that's deceiving, but a fact nonetheless) to a 4-0 record in Tokyo so far. Through the group stage, Doncic averaged 28.3 points, 10.7 rebounds, seven assists, 1.7 blocks, one steal per game. Doncic had 48 points in Slovenia's win over Argentina to kick off the group stage, the second-highest single-game output in Olympic history. He barely missed a triple-double in Slovenia's win over Spain (12 points, 14 rebounds, nine assists) -- a feat that hasn't been accomplished in Olympic play since LeBron James in 2012. He nearly did it again with 20 points, 11 assists and eight boards in their quarterfinal win over Germany. Doncic joined the Slovenian national team when he was a teenager in 2017, and he immediately led his country to gold at the Turkey EuroBasket. Slovenia, which has never qualified for the Olympics until this year, has been the best international offense in the world since that time. With a win over France, Slovenia would ensure itself of becoming the first team since Croatia and Lithuania in 1992 to win a medal in its inaugural Olympics. Even if Slovenia loses to France, they'd still have a shot at the bronze medal against the Australia-USA loser. There are still two games to go, but can you imagine Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard and company going head to head with Doncic with a gold medal on the line?

Neither team scored again until the bottom of the fifth, when the Americans' advantage swelled to 3-0 thanks to a solo home run by Tyler Austin. (Austin had also scored as part of Casas' homer.) On the pitching side of things, Team USA was paced by veteran southpaw Scott Kazmir. He delivered five shutout innings for the Americans, holding the Dominican Republican to just two hits and a walk. Kazmir struck out five of the 18 batters he faced and threw 80 pitches overall. The Americans then received four shutout innings from a combination of four relievers: Brandon Dickson, Scott McGough, Anthony Gose\u00a0and David Robertson. Robertson allowed the only run of the night, yielding a solo home run to Charlie Valerio with two outs in the ninth inning. South Korea and Japan's game is scheduled to begin at 6 a.m. EDT.

More medals were handed out in track and field, while the Team USA baseball and women's basketball were in action. Wednesday should prove to be another exciting day of Olympic action, with track and field taking center stage again. With all that in mind, here's a recap of the Day 12 action and a look ahead at what's to come on Wednesday. American star Sydney McLaughlin won a gold medal in her first ever appearance in an Olympic finals on Tuesday night in women's 400-meter hurdles. McLaughlin recorded a time of 51.46, which was enough to upstage defending champion Dalilah Muhammad. Muhammad wasn't too far behind her American teammate, as she posted a time of 51.58 to earn the silver medal. McLaughlin managed to break her own world record time with the victory. It also marked just the second time in history that a woman posted a time under 52 seconds in the event -- and both McLaughlin and Muhammad managed to do so. McLaughlin, 21, also became the youngest person ever to medal in the event. The United States defeated the Dominican Republic, 3-1, on Tuesday and advanced to play the loser of Thursday's semifinal contest between Japan and South Korea. The Americans were able to open the scoring with a two-run home run from Boston Red Sox first base prospect Triston Casas. In addition, the United States added a solo home run from Tyler Austin. Former Tampa Bay Rays left-hander Scott Kazmir pitched five shutout innings and struck out five batters in the process. If the United States defeats Japan or South Korea, they'll have a chance to play for the gold medal. However, if the American lose, they'll face the Dominican Republic once again, and that will be for the bronze medal. The United States women's basketball team came away with a 79-55 win over Australia in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Now the Americans are headed to the semifinals to face Serbia and will look to extend their ridiculous 53-game Olympic winning streak. Breanna Stewart led the charge for Team USA as she scored 23 points, secured five rebounds and dished out three assists in 23 minutes. Stewart would've had a chance to beat Lisa Leslie's American Olympic record of 35 points, but she didn't play much of the second half since the Americans had a commanding lead. Great Britain's Sky Brown became the youngest medalist in her country's history at just 13 in the park final. Japan's Kokona Hiraki won the silver medal and is just six weeks younger than Brown. Hiraki's teammate, Sakura Yosozumi, came away with the gold medal and seemed like a grizzled veteran at 19.", "list": ["Men's 800m final, 8:05 a.m.", "Men's 200m final, 8:55 a.m.", "Men's triple jump final, 10 p.m.", "Men's shot put final, 10:05 p.m.", "Men's 110m hurdles final, 10:55 p.m.", "Men's park skateboarding final, 11:30 p.m."], "preprocessed": "2020 tokyo olympics come home stretch plenty action tuesday medal hand track field team usa baseball woman basketball action wednesday prove another exciting day olympic action track field take center stage mind recap day 12 action look ahead come wednesday american star sydney mclaughlin gold medal first ever appearance olympic final tuesday night woman 400 meter hurdle mclaughlin record time 51.46 enough upstage defend champion dalilah muhammad muhammad far behind american teammate post time 51.58 earn silver medal mclaughlin manage break world record time victory also mark second time history woman post time 52 second event mclaughlin muhammad manage mclaughlin 21 also become young person ever medal event united states defeat dominican republic 3 1 tuesday advance play loser thursday semifinal contest japan south korea americans able open scoring two run home run boston red sox first base prospect triston casas addition united states add solo home run tyler austin former tampa bay rays leave hander scott kazmir pitch five shutout inning strike five batter process united states defeat japan south korea chance play gold medal however american lose face dominican republic bronze medal united states woman basketball team come away 79 55 win australia quarterfinal wednesday americans head semifinal face serbia look extend ridiculous 53 game olympic winning streak breanna stewart lead charge team usa score 23 point secure five rebound dish three assist 23 minute stewart would chance beat lisa leslie american olympic record 35 point play much second half since americans commanding lead great britain sky brown become young medalist country history 13 park final japan kokona hiraki silver medal six week young brown hiraki teammate sakura yosozumi come away gold medal seem like grizzle veteran 19"}, {"link": "https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/tokyo-olympics-2020-baseball-semifinal-odds-predictions-japan-vs-south-korea-picks-from-proven-expert/", "title": "Tokyo Olympics 2020 baseball semifinal odds, predictions: Japan vs. South Korea picks from proven expert", "subtitle": "CBS Sports baseball expert Matt Snyder, who went 26-18 in the 2020 MLB playoffs, just released his picks for the semifinal between Japan and South Korea on Wednesday", "author": "CBS Sports Staff", "date": "8/4/2021", "time": "7:30", "section": ["Why you should back Japan", "Why you should back South Korea", "How to make 2020 Tokyo Olympics baseball picks for South Korea vs. Japan"], "body": "South Korea can return to baseball's gold medal game when it takes on host country Japan in a semifinal of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on Wednesday at Yokohama Baseball Stadium.

A former player for Indiana University and a member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, Snyder has been a baseball writer with CBS Sports since 2011. CBS Sports' longest-tenured baseball expert combines simple logic learned from his baseball-playing days with an extensive background in analytics. He went 26-18 in the 2020 MLB playoffs, including 8-4 on World Series bets. Anybody who followed him saw some huge returns. Now, Snyder has studied the Japan vs. South Korea baseball matchup and revealed his expert picks and predictions. You can see his top 2020 Olympics picks only at SportsLine. Here are the latest Olympics baseball odds and betting trends for South Korea vs. Japan: In a quest to win gold on home soil, Japan has fielded a team of domestic professional stars. The Japanese roster features center fielder Yuki Yanagita, who won the Pacific League MVP and Japan Series MVP awards last season, as well as former Central League MVP Tetsudo Yamada and former Central League batting champion Seiya Suzuki. In addition, Japan will have its ace on the mound in Yoshinobu Yamamoto. A righty with a 98 mile per hour fastball and who is highly coveted by MLB teams, Yamamoto has a 1.82 ERA in 113.2 innings this season. He went six scoreless innings with nine strikeouts against the Dominican Republic earlier in the Olympics and will be on six-days' rest. The South Koreans have pitched better than Japan so far in Tokyo. South Korea has a 3.44 ERA so far in the Olympics, which ranks second in the field behind the United States. In the South Koreans' last game, they limited Israel to one run on three hits in an 11-1 victory. Meanwhile Japan has a 4.18 ERA, which ranks fourth. In addition, South Korea has dominated the series against Japan in the Olympics. The South Koreans haven't lost to Japan in the Summer Games since 1996 though baseball has not been an Olympic sport since 2008. Snyder is going\u00a0under on the total and he's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping all over one side of the run line.

It got there in emphatic fashion with a 79-55 win over Australia in the quarterfinals on Wednesday morning to run its incredible Olympic winning streak to 53 games. Slow starts had been a theme for Team USA in Tokyo, as it trailed after the first quarter in all three of its group stage games. There was no such issue against Australia, however. Whether it was the loss to the Opals in a pre-Olympics exhibition game, or just a desire to put some shaky early performances behind them, the Americans came out looking like they had something to prove. Using a 17-0 run in the middle of the opening frame, during which they held Australia scoreless for over five minutes, the Americans jumped out to a 26-12 lead after the first quarter and didn't look back. Save for a few possessions in the second quarter, Team USA led by double digits the rest of the way, and was on cruise control for the entire second half. On an individual level, Breanna Stewart led the way with her best performance of this tournament. She was a big part of the first-quarter surge to take control, and had 20 points by halftime (Australia as a team only had 27 at the break). Stewart finished with 23 points, five rebounds and three assists in just 23 minutes. If the game had been closer and she didn't sit out much of the second half, she would have had a chance to make a run at Lisa Leslie's American Olympic record of 35 points. Team USA is now just two wins away from a historic seventh straight gold medal. First, the team will have to get past a semifinal contest against Serbia, which used a huge fourth-quarter comeback to beat China in the quarterfinals.

On Wednesday, the United States faces Australia in a highly-intriguing quarterfinal matchup. Team USA is loaded with stars, though the Americans fell to Australia in an exhibition game in July. Australia struggled, at least by its standards, in group play and will look to pull an upset. The winner advances to the semifinals on Friday to play the winner of China vs. Serbia. Tip-off is scheduled for 12:40 a.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Team USA women's basketball as the 15.5-point favorite in the latest USA vs. Australia odds. The over-under for total points expected is set at 160. Before finalizing any Australia vs. USA basketball picks or predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics rolling on, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Wednesday's USA vs. Australia matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Australia vs. USA: Team USA is a double-digit favorite for a reason. The Americans are absolutely loaded from a roster perspective and, even without playing their best basketball at times in Tokyo, they haven't been challenged to a high degree. A'Ja Wilson has been the team's star to this point, averaging 20.3 points and 10.0 rebounds, while shooting 65 percent from the floor. Wilson isn't alone, though, as she is flanked by incredible size and athleticism in the frontcourt and skill on the perimeter. Breanna Stewart, one of the world's best players, is averaging 13.7 points, 10.3 rebounds and 5.7 assists per game. Veteran guard Sue Bird is No. 2 in the tournament in assists, averaging 7.7 per game, and the Americans also have strong shooters at multiple spots. It will be interesting to see if the United States can find a new gear as the knockout stage begins, but its \"A\" game is untouchable in this tournament. Team USA is the prohibitive favorite and for good reason. No squad can match the Americans' athleticism, talent and depth, but that is a different conversation than evaluating a single game from a point-spread perspective. Australia gave the Americans fits in their exhibition matchup, and the 3-point line was a huge reason for the upset win. The Australians connected on 10 3-pointers on 26 attempts, while Team USA shot just 2-of-18 from downtown. That may not be projectable in terms of the upcoming matchup, but Australia can play small, spreading Team USA out and taking advantage of passing and driving lanes. Furthermore, Australia is due for positive regression after stumbling out of the gate in Tokyo, and the Australians have the third-most WNBA players in the tournament behind only the United States and Canada. Tierney has taken a close look at the USA vs. Australia Olympic basketball matchup from all angles and is leaning under on the point total.

He hasn't played in the majors since 2019 and in his four years he played for the Yankees, Brewers, Giants and Twins. Not far behind is Casas, who is 4 for 13 with a double and two homers.

The United States's women's basketball team is looking to win its seventh straight gold medal. That journey could come to an end if the Americans don't beat Australia on Wednesday. The Opals have already secured an upset against the world's top team in an exhibition setting while missing a key piece, and they'll look to do so again to keep their gold medal hopes alive. The latest 2020 Olympics odds from Caesars Sportsbook list the United States as a 14.5-point favorite and the over-under is set at 160 in that matchup. Baseball, women's golf and plenty of track and field events are among the other sports on the Olympic schedule for Tuesday evening and early Wednesday. Before locking in any 2020 Tokyo Olympics picks or predictions for those events or others, you need to see what SportsLine Olympics expert Mike Tierney is saying. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. In the past two Olympic Games, his advice helped those who followed him cash in big, and he already has nailed a huge winner at Tokyo 2020. Tierney kicked off his Olympics 2020 picks by taking Norway's Kristian Blummenfelt (+600) as his pick to win gold in Sunday's men's triathlon, and the 27-year-old ran away with the event. He also picked Chinese legend Long Ma (+163) to win the men's table tennis final over ITTF world No. 1 Fan Zhendong and called Japan (+100), upsetting Team USA in the softball final. At the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in 2018, he nailed Suzanne Schulting (+2500) of the Netherlands and Norway's Havard Lorentzen (+800) to triumph in speed skating and the USA's Mikaela Shiffrin (+185) to win the giant slalom. Tierney also took the under (10.5) on the Americans' gold-medal count, and that also cashed as the USA came in with nine. And at the Rio 2016 Summer Games, Tierney told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. Anyone who followed Tierney's advice cashed in huge. Now, Tierney has been studying the 2020 Tokyo Olympics event schedule and digging down into individual and team sports. He has released three confident Olympic best bets for Tuesday. He's only sharing his expert Olympics 2020 picks at SportsLine. One giveaway: The United States is a massive 14.5-point favorite ahead of its Wednesday matchup against Australia, but Tierney doesn't think the Americans will run up the score against the underdogs in a barn burner. He's leaning under on the game's point total of 160. The world's top women's team has failed to cover the spread in three straight games despite its 3-0 record. The United States has secured double-digit wins in two of its three games while winning by an average of 11 points, but second-ranked Australia has five WNBA players at its disposal and topped the United States in an exhibition earlier this year. The Opals held the United States to 67 points in Las Vegas, Nevada, in July. That was without Liz Cambage protecting the rim. If Australia can force tons of turnovers in this rematch, it can keep the score low. Tierney also has a strong play on the Team USA vs. Australia spread in women's basketball, as well as a pair of other best bets that each return more than 3-1.\u00a0He's only sharing his Olympics 2020 picks at SportsLine.

It was tight and it also required nerves of steel from the penalty spot, but the South Americans are now there with the chance to defend their 2016 title. A feisty affair saw nine yellow cards dished out as Andre Jardine's men made no mistake as Mexico missed twice. Dani Alves led by example with the opening spot kick and Gabriel Martinelli, Bruno Guimaraes and Reinier also converted. Champions back in 1992 and silver medalists in 2000, Luis de la Fuente's men now have a shot at another gold, and they are also guaranteed a third medal by reaching the final. Asensio's winner emphasized the quality of the Spanish squad these games and the likes of Dani Olmo and Pedri have earned a long break after this capped the end of a long season followed by UEFA Euro 2020. Ultimately, it was heartbreak for the home nation as they fell just short of taking the match to penalties after surviving an earlier scare when Spain were awarded a penalty which was then overturned by VAR. Samurai Blue came up a little short but the bronze medal contest does offer Hajime Moriyasu's men the chance to win a first-ever soccer Olympic medal for their country. Like Japan, El Tri just did not have enough to go any further with penalties a tough way to go after Eduardo Aguirre and Johan Vasquez failed to score from the spot. All is not lost with a second medal a possibility for the 2012 champions but that will feel like scant consolation for Jaime Lozano's squad who were unable to follow up on their explosive quarterfinal progress. Given the tight nature of both semifinals and the fact that neither side has been particularly prolific in front of goal while in Japan, the chances of a goal-filled final in Yokohama are slim. However, with everything on the line for the gold medal, perhaps Spain can rediscover their scoring touch from extra time against Ivory Coast or Brazil can replicate the opening 30-minute blitz against Germany.", "list": null, "preprocessed": "man olympic soccer final set champion brazil set face spain yokohama weekend tight pair semifinal tuesday go extra time one way penalty take 115th minute spanish squeeze past host japan marco asensio effort saitama brazilian need penalty overcome mexico kashima 120 goalless minute japanese mexican side meet bronze medal game saitama stadium 2002 selecao la rojita battle gold medal international stadium yokohama close event crave even coverage world game listen follow \u00a1 qu\u00e9 golazo daily cbs soccer podcast take beyond pitch around globe commentary preview recap look back semis tight also require nerve steel penalty spot south americans chance defend 2016 title feisty affair see nine yellow card dish andre jardine man make mistake mexico miss twice dani alve lead example opening spot kick gabriel martinelli bruno guimaraes reini also convert champion back 1992 silver medalist 2000 luis de la fuente man shot another gold also guarantee third medal reach final asensio winner emphasize quality spanish squad game like dani olmo pedri earn long break cap end long season follow uefa euro 2020 ultimately heartbreak home nation fall short take match penalty survive early scare spain award penalty overturn var samurai blue come little short bronze medal contest offer hajime moriyasu man chance win first ever soccer olympic medal country like japan el tri enough go penalty tough way go eduardo aguirre johan vasquez fail score spot lose second medal possibility 2012 champion feel like scant consolation jaime lozano squad unable follow explosive quarterfinal progress give tight nature semifinal fact neither side particularly prolific front goal japan chance goal fill final yokohama slim however everything line gold medal perhaps spain rediscover scoring touch extra time ivory coast brazil replicate open 30 minute blitz germany"}, {"link": "https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/2020-tokyo-olympics-athing-mu-19-becomes-first-american-to-win-gold-in-womens-800-meters-final-since-1968/", "title": "2020 Tokyo Olympics: Athing Mu, 19, becomes first American to win gold in women's 800 meters final since 1968", "subtitle": "Mu finished first in the event while fellow American Raevyn Rogers won bronze", "author": "Wajih AlBaroudi", "date": "8/3/2021", "time": "13:18", "section": null, "body": "First-time Olympian Athing Mu won gold for Team USA in Tuesday's women's 800-meter final and made history in the process.

Now, it's what makes her story so powerful", "author": "Matt Norlander", "date": "8/3/2021", "time": "12:29", "section": null, "body": "Bronze never felt like more of a win than this. Early Tuesday morning, Simone Biles returned to competition and in the process made the women's balance beam final the most anticipated event of these Games. The athlete (which is to say: the human) with more expectation, hype, marketing and pressure attached to them -- to the point of it practically being an appendage -- at the 2020 Olympics got back on the stage. Her stage. A stage that's 3.9 inches wide. What Biles proceeded to do was, in some ways, as admirable as any gold medal-winning routine she's ever had. It might well be, already, the most cherished of all her Olympic performances. Biles' rendition on the balance beam was not a flawless display, but it was nonetheless a vintage showing by the greatest gymnast in history. Grace, power, fluidity, athleticism, poise. Biles intentionally dialed down her routine in order to better protect her physical welfare, but that didn't preclude her from finding the podium. Out was her usual/insanely difficult double twist, double backflip dismount -- the move, called a \"Biles,\" is literally named after her -- and in was a (still-magnificent) double pike. Biles took bronze with a 14.000 score, repeating her third-place showing on beam from Rio in 2016. \"This definitely feels sweeter than Rio's bronze medal on beam because I did a good beam routine,\" Biles told the media Tuesday. She also told NBC, \"It means more than all of the golds because I've pushed through so much the last five years and the last week while I've even been here.\" China's Guan Chenchen was the final gymnast to perform. She won gold with a 14.633, while her teammate, Tang Xijing, captured silver (14.233). It's been a week since Biles stepped away from the team all-around competition to protect her mental health and save Team USA's chances at a medal. As each day passed and Biles opted out of individual event after individual event, it looked like we'd seen the last of a unique American talent in her arena. Then came Monday. The moment USA Gymnastics announced Biles would indeed compete, that's when Tuesday's beam final became the biggest event at these Games. It also meant Biles would confront more attention, in competition, than she's ever had. Additionally, a return might mean she'd have to dance with, or dodge, a demon or three on that beam. It doesn't matter that the general public was not allowed at the Ariake Gymnastics Center. The eyes of the world were on Biles Tuesday, and she came through magnificently. \"I had nerves but I felt pretty good,\" Biles said after taking the bronze. The irony is that, although beam is Biles' weakest event, it's the one that gave her the best chance at competing safely.\u00a0The twisties would not be a factor because she would, mostly, not let them be involved in the routine (which is why she switched to a double-pike dismount). After a relatively shaky qualifying round, Biles entered the final with the seventh-highest score (14.066) out of the eight finalists. She didn't have to do this for anyone, but clearly she felt good enough and healthy enough to do it for herself. That's all that matters. Her poise is all the more incredible after the fact, as\u00a0Biles also revealed Tuesday that one of her aunt's unexpectedly died two days ago. \"I was just happy to be able to perform regardless of the outcome,\" Biles said. \"I did it for me and I was proud of myself for being able to compete one more time.\" For years we've equated Biles' GOAT status with her haul of gold medals, because that's what we as sports fans and pundits tend to do. Yet Tuesday's performance -- combined with the conversation from the past week about Biles' mental well-being -- partly disproved that. Biles' standing in Olympics and gymnastics history is not, will not, only be defined by her four gold medals, none of which were won in Tokyo. You can inspire without being the best. You can win bronze, or silver, and still be a champion. Heading into the Games, it was presumed Biles would just be Biles in full and add another three, four or five more golds to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. As if something like that could ever be preordained. Instead, she didn't win any; Biles won a silver in the team all-around in addition to Tuesday's bronze. The idea that she would not win one gold was unthinkable before a week ago. Now it's sort of an oh-by-the-way. This is a good thing. \"Just to have one more opportunity to compete at the Olympic Games meant the world,\" Biles said. \"Training for five years and then coming here, and then kind of being triggered and not being able to do anything, it wasn't fun.\" Tuesday's bronze was historic, too. The achievement tied Biles with the great Shannon Miller for the most Olympic medals by a U.S. gymnast. Four of Biles' seven Olympics medals are golds, which is what elevates her to a higher tier than anyone else in the eyes of most who know gymnastics best. Just getting to see her one more time on an Olympic stage was the reward. It would have been all too understandable if Biles ultimately decided to not compete again in Tokyo. Watch that vault attempt again from the team all-around and see what the slow-motion replay catches. Biles, coming back to earth after the most basic of launch attempts, is rattled. Her spatial cognizance failing. That truth is evident in the face. The uncertainty, the doubt, the fear. She was in danger. The mental anguish piled on top of Biles led to that moment, and the past week couldn't have been much easier. Then Tuesday arrived, and Biles met the moment with elegance and style. This was no coronation for her; that came in 2016. But in Tokyo she was the first woman since 1992 to qualify for every possible medal event: team all-around, individual all-around, vault, floor, uneven bars, balance beam. Not competing in all but two of those tells a bigger story, one that will probably be remembered just as much as any of her performances, and that's important. Was Tuesday the last time we'll ever see Biles compete? She's 24, which in gymnastics is easily retirement age. Biles is such a phenomenal athlete and competitor that anything seems possible. But if Tuesday is the end, what a cathartic way to go out. Biles, on her own terms, exits with a medal that isn't gold but might be more valuable than any first-place finish.", "list": null, "preprocessed": "bronze never feel like win early tuesday morning simone bile return competition process make woman balance beam final anticipate event game athlete say human expectation hype marketing pressure attach point practically appendage 2020 olympic get back stage stage stage 3.9 inch wide bile proceed way admirable gold medal win routine ever might well already cherished olympic performance bile rendition balance beam flawless display nonetheless vintage showing great gymnast history grace power fluidity athleticism poise bile intentionally dial routine order well protect physical welfare preclude find podium usual insanely difficult double twist double backflip dismount move call bile literally name still magnificent double pike bile take bronze 14.000 score repeat third place showing beam rio 2016 definitely feel sweet rio bronze medal beam good beam routine bile tell medium tuesday also tell nbc mean gold push much last five year last week even china guan chenchen final gymnast perform gold 14.633 teammate tang xijing capture silver 14.233 week since bile step away team around competition protect mental health save team usa chance medal day pass bile opt individual event individual event look like see last unique american talent arena come monday moment usa gymnastic announce bile would indeed compete tuesday beam final become big event game also mean bile would confront attention competition ever additionally return might mean dance dodge demon three beam matter general public allow ariake gymnastic center eye world bile tuesday come magnificently nerve feel pretty good bile say take bronze irony although beam bile weak event one give good chance compete safely \u00a0 twistie would factor would mostly let involve routine switch double pike dismount relatively shaky qualifying round bile enter final seventh high score 14.066 eight finalist anyone clearly feel good enough healthy enough matter poise incredible fact \u00a0 bile also reveal tuesday one aunt unexpectedly die two day ago happy able perform regardless outcome bile say proud able compete one time year equate bile goat status haul gold medal sport fan pundit tend yet tuesday performance combine conversation past week bile mental well partly disprove bile standing olympic gymnastic history define four gold medal none tokyo inspire without good win bronze silver still champion head game presume bile would bile full add another three four five gold r\u00e9sum\u00e9 something like could ever preordain instead win bile silver team around addition tuesday bronze idea would win one gold unthinkable week ago sort oh way good thing one opportunity compete olympic game mean world bile say training five year come kind trigger able anything fun tuesday bronze historic achievement tie bile great shannon miller olympic medal u.s gymnast four bile seven olympic medal gold elevate high tier anyone else eye know gymnastic well get see one time olympic stage reward would understandable bile ultimately decide compete tokyo watch vault attempt team around see slow motion replay catch bile come back earth basic launch attempt rattle spatial cognizance fail truth evident face uncertainty doubt fear danger mental anguish pile top bile lead moment past week could much easy tuesday arrive bile meet moment elegance style coronation come 2016 tokyo first woman since 1992 qualify every possible medal event team around individual around vault floor uneven bar balance beam compete two tell big story one probably remember much performance important tuesday last time ever see bile compete 24 gymnastic easily retirement age bile phenomenal athlete competitor anything seem possible tuesday end cathartic way go bile term exit medal gold might valuable first place finish"}, {"link": "https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/japan-vs-spain-odds-picks-predictions-soccer-expert-reveals-best-bets-for-tokyo-olympics-2020/", "title": "Japan vs. Spain odds, picks, predictions: Soccer expert reveals best bets for Tokyo Olympics 2020", "subtitle": "Martin Green has generated nearly $19,000 for $100 bettors since the 2017-18 season", "author": "CBS Sports Staff", "date": "8/3/2021", "time": "8:35", "section": ["Why you should back Spain", "Why you should back Japan", "How to make Spain vs. Japan picks"], "body": "Spain won its only Olympic men's soccer title on its own soil, and now it tries to deny Japan a chance to do the same when the teams square off in Tuesday's semifinals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

Caesars Sportsbook lists Spain as the +110 favorite (risk $100 to win $110) on the 90-minute money line in its latest Japan vs. Spain odds, while Japan is the +240 underdog. The over-under for total goals scored is set at 2.5. Before you lock in your Spain vs. Japan picks or 2020 Olympics soccer predictions, you need to see what consummate soccer insider Martin Green has to say. After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Since then, his European soccer picks have been spot-on. Green has generated nearly $19,000 for $100 bettors since the 2017-18 season, and he has his finger on the pulse of the game all over the globe. Now, Green has taken a close look at the Spain vs. Japan matchup and revealed his 2020 Olympic soccer picks. You can head to SportsLine now to see the picks. Here are the Olympics soccer odds and betting trends for Japan vs. Spain: The Spaniards have a distinct talent advantage, because La Liga teams are required by Spanish law to release native players for Olympic competition. That means such stars as Mikel Oyarzabal, Dani Olmo and Pedri are all part of the squad. They are three of the six players who were on the senior national team that reached the Euro 2020 semifinals a month ago. The other three form a strong shield in front of the net, with elite young defenders Eric Garcia (Barcelona) and Pau Torres (Villarreal) holding a firm line in front of Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Unai Simon. Wolverhampton's Rafa Mir scored three times in Saturday's victory. He saved the Spaniards from a humiliating loss with an equalizer in the 93rd minute and tallied twice more to cement the victory. Olmo and Oyarzabal also scored, and they hope that sudden offensive surge will push them to gold. Oyarzabal, Olmo and Marco Asensio form a dangerous trio, and Oyarzabal can also set up goals. He has scored 21 over the past two seasons with La Liga's Real Sociedad and has added 19 assists. The Japanese have allowed one goal in the tournament, and that was in a 2-1 victory against fellow semifinalist Mexico. The team was built with defense in mind, with fullbacks Maya Yoshida and Hiroki Sakai and defensive midfielder Wataru Endo chosen as the three over-age players. The Japanese have been impossible to break down, and Japan is succeeding with its traditional disciplined and organized attack. It has a lot of confidence with victories over Mexico and France, and it beat Spain 1-0 in the group stage when the teams met in the Olympics at London 2012. Japan is 7-3-3 in its last three Olympics appearances, including the draw against New Zealand. Japan outshot the Kiwis 21-8 in that match and put six on target but could not bury one. Real Madrid 20-year-old prospect Takefusa Kubo has three of Japan's goals as he tries to secure a future with the Spanish powerhouse. Green has taken a close look at the Spain vs. Japan match from all sides, and he's leaning under on the goal total. He also has two confident best bets and a full breakdown of this 2020 Tokyo Olympics soccer semifinal. He's only sharing those expert soccer picks at SportsLine. So who wins Japan vs. Spain?

The Brazilians won their first gold medal at Rio 2016, and they are eager to show that they can win the Olympics title without the backing of the home crowd. They also want to avenge a 2-1 loss to El Tri in the final at London 2012 that delayed their first gold-medal ceremony. The winner will face Japan or Spain in Saturday's final. Brazil has more talent but struggled to a 1-0 win against Egypt in Saturday's Tokyo 2020 quarterfinals, while Mexico cruised to a 6-3 victory against South Korea the same day. Kickoff is set for 4 a.m ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Brazil as the +105 favorite (risk $100 to win $105) on the 90-minute money line in its latest Mexico vs. Brazil odds, while Mexico is the +230 underdog.

Now, Green has taken a close look at the Brazil vs. Mexico matchup and revealed his Olympics 2020 soccer expert picks. You can head to SportsLine now to see the picks. Here are the 2020 Olympic soccer odds and betting trends for Mexico vs. Brazil: The Selecao has their usual swagger, even if they haven't been lighting up the tournament so far. Still, the Brazilians are unbeaten through four games (3-1-0) and have an 8-3 goal advantage. They beat Germany 4-2 and Saudi Arabia 3-1 but struggled in a scoreless draw with the Ivory Coast. They held 63 percent possession against Egypt and had five shots on target but scored just one goal. Still, the combination of Matheus Cunha and Richarlison is as good as it gets in this event. Cunha scored the winner against the Egyptians on an assist from the Everton man. Richarlison is the tournament's top scorer with five goals, and Cunha has scored twice. Plenty of playmakers can create chances for the dynamic duo, with Bruno Guimaraes, Antony and Claudinho among the creative forces. Brazil manager Andre Jardine opted to focus on defense with his over-age picks, with 38-year-old Dani Alves captaining the squad and Diego Carlos, 28, joining him on the back line. Goalkeeper Santos, 31, also is a steady presence behind them. Brazil has not lost an Olympic match since the London 2012 final (6-4-0). El Tri comes in with soaring confidence after destroying a strong South Korea side while Brazil struggled to beat upstart Egypt. The Egyptians had a few chances to get an equalizer, and Mexico's attack is far better in the hands of over-age choices Henry Martin and Luis Romo. The Mexicans also have a veteran in net, with goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa providing the young players confidence. Martin and young star midfielder Sebastian Cordova both have three goals in the tournament, while Romo, Alexis Vega and Eduardo Aguirre have all scored twice. Romo has been the engine, and he had a goal and two assists in the quarterfinal, while Henry is the star striker for perennial Liga MX contender Club America. Mexico leads the tournament with 14 goals, one more than South Korea and five more than No. 3 Brazil. It demolished the South Koreans on Saturday, converting six of eight shots on net while outshooting them 23-7 overall.

The New Zealand native didn't transition to female until she was 35 years old. She was able to participate in the Games due to a change in the International Olympic Committee's transgender guidelines that took place in 2015. That change states that athletes who transition from male to female can compete in the women's category as long as their total testosterone level in serum is less than 10 nanomoles per liter for at least 12 months. \"I am grateful and humbled by the kindness and support that has been given to me by so many New Zealanders,\" she said,\u00a0according to The Guardian, after being selected to compete in the Games in early June. \"When I broke my arm at the Commonwealth Games three years ago, I was advised that my sporting career had likely reached its end.

After losing to Team USA in the quarterfinals of the 2004 Games, the Spaniards dropped back-to-back gold-medal matchups before falling in the semifinals at Rio in 2016. Spain attempts to halt the trend and post its first Olympic victory over Team USA in 13 tries when the teams clash in the quarterfinals of the men's basketball tournament at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on Tuesday. Tip-off at Saitama Super Arena is set for 12:40 a.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Team USA as a 12-point favorite in the latest USA vs. Spain odds, while the over-under for total points has been set at 179. Before finalizing any Spain vs. USA picks or Olympic basketball predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics rolling on, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Tuesday's Team USA vs. Spain matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Spain vs. Team USA: After having its Olympic winning streak halted at 25 games in its group-play opener by France, Team USA has been its usual dominant self. The team rebounded from the stunning 83-76 defeat by trouncing Iran and the Czech Republic by a combined 89 points. The Americans' last two Olympic wins over Spain were by single digits, but they've won by an average of 22.6 points while going 12-0 all-time against the Spaniards in the Summer Games. Team USA has five players averaging double digits in points, with Jayson Tatum leading the way at 16.7 after recording a game-high 27 against the Czech Republic. Kevin Durant added 23 in that victory, making him the only member of the team to reach double figures in all three group-play contests. Bam Adebayo has proven he's capable of coming up with a big performance, as he recorded Team USA's only double-double of the Olympics thus far with 12 points and 10 rebounds in the loss to France, while Zach LaVine has scored 13 points in each of his last two games. Spain kicked off its preliminary round with double-digit victories over Japan and Argentina before falling to Slovenia 95-87 in a showdown for the top spot in Group C. The key to Spain's offense has been Ricky Rubio, who helped his country to the silver medal in the 2008 Games and bronze in Rio five years ago. The 30-year-old point guard has been the team's leading scorer in each game and finished with 26 points against Argentina after going 5-for-6 from beyond the arc. At 41 and 36 years old, respectively, Pau and Marc Gasol aren't contributing offensively like they used to, but Spain is receiving solid contributions from several other players. After going nearly 21 minutes without scoring against Japan, Rudy Fernandez recorded eight points versus Argentina and went 4-for-9 from 3-point range in the loss to Slovenia to finish with 12 points. Sergio Llull has hit double digits in back-to-back contests, while Alberto Abrines was 4-for-7 from beyond the arc en route to a 14-point effort against Slovenia. Tierney has taken a close look at the Team USA vs. Spain quarterfinal matchup from all angles and is leaning under on the point total. He's also found a critical X-factor that has him jumping on one side of the Spain vs. Team USA spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball predictions at SportsLine.
