The track federation has alleged that Tirop, a two-time world championships bronze medalist, was stabbed by her husband in their home,\u00a0according to the Associated Press. \"Kenya has lost a jewel,\" the federation said in a statement. According to reports, Tirop was found dead in her home in Iten, which is located in western Kenya. It is a town that is famous for serving as a training base for many long distance runners. Kenyan media has also reported that Tirop had stab wounds in her abdomen, but local police haven't announced any details regarding the manner of her death. Tirop routinely competed in 5,000-meter and cross country running competitions. In 2015, she became the second-youngest ever gold medalist when she finished in first at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships. She also was a junior champion at the African Cross Country Championships in 2014, where she held a record time of 14:50.36 minutes. Tirop won a bronze medal in the 10,000-meter events at the 2017 and 2019 World Athletics Championships and is th world record holder in the 10-kilometer women's event.",

  "body": "Team USA may have lost a key contributor just five months ahead of the 2022 Beijing Winter Games. Reigning Olympic luge silver medalist Chris Mazdzer broke his right foot during a preseason training run on Thursday, bringing his availability for the Games into question. Mazdzer told the AP he will \"need some time\" to determine whether he can compete at an Olympic level by February. \"I knew something was wrong right away since I couldn't put any pressure on my foot, and imaging confirmed that I broke my foot in a few places,\" said Mazdzer, who competed on season 26 of the Dancing Stars. \"After investing physically, mentally and financially for this Olympic year, the game plan changed in just the matter of a few seconds,\" he added. Mazdzer told the AP his foot broke after it slammed into a piece of ice while traveling over 75 mph. The 33-year-old was practicing with a few of his American teammates at the 2014 Olympic track in Krasnaya Polyana, Russia prior to the injury. Mazdzer, a three-time Olympian, competed on that very track during the 2014 Games. The absence of Mazder would be a major hit to USA Luge, which is counting on him to compete in both the doubles and singles events. Mazder, the only World Cup-level luger to compete in both disciplines, won a silver medal at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games in the singles event. Mazdzer's doubles partner Jayson Terdiman is confident Mazdzer can return to his pre-injury form in time to defend his medal. \"Over the last three years, we have overcome numerous injuries and still come back stronger,\" Terdiman said. \"I believe this instance will be no different. Chris and I are both mentally tough, and we know how to get through anything. ... Neither of us has been deterred from the end goal, putting Team USA on the podium in Beijing.\" After beginning its training in Russia, USA Luge is set to continue those preparations in China this fall. The 2022 Winter Games will take place Feb. 4-20 in Beijing.",

One of which was that no fans were allowed to attend event. Similar protocols will also be in place for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. On Wednesday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) gave an update on the upcoming Winter Games, including their policy for fans. In their release, the IOC stated that only people in China will be able to attend the games. Here's the IOC's entire statement on the matter: \"Tickets will be sold exclusively to spectators residing in China's mainland, who meet the requirements of the COVID-19 countermeasures. Specific requirements on COVID-19 countermeasures for spectators from China's mainland and the details of ticketing arrangements are under discussion and development, and will be released to the public in due course once they are finalised.\" While it's unfortunate, especially for fans that aren't from China, this is a step up from the Tokyo Olympics, where no fans were allowed due to an increase in Japan's COVID-19 cases that coincided with the dates of the games. On top of the fan policy, the IOC is taking the extra measure of making life easier for athletes who are vaccinated against COVID-19. \"All athletes and Games participants who are fully vaccinated will enter the closed-loop management system upon arrival. Games participants who are not fully vaccinated will have to serve a 21-day quarantine upon arrival in Beijing.\" There will also be COVID-19 testing in place at the Games.",

  "body": "Two-time Olympic gold medalist Klete Keller pleaded guilty to a felony charge stemming from his participation in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. The 39-year-old swimmer agreed to obstructing an official proceeding -- one of seven criminal charges he incurred in February, but prosecutors dropped the other six -- and can resultantly face up to 27 months in prison. Prosecutors claimed Keller wore a Team USA jacket during the riot, stayed in the Capitol for an hour and yelled expletives about Democratic party congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Those actions amounted to obstructing an official proceeding charge, one that has a recommended sentence of 21 to 27 months in prison. U.S. district judge of the District of Columbia Richard Leon, who presided over Keller's case and will later sentence him, is not limited to that range. Over 600 people, including Keller, have been charged for their actions in the January attack on the Capital. The rioters injured 140 police officers, according to the Capitol Police Officers' union. Keller, a Phoenix native and former USC star, appeared in three Olympics (2000, 2004, 2008) and won five medals. He's best known for anchoring the men's 800m free relay team in 2004, when the Americans gave the Australians their first loss at the international level in seven years. The Reno-Gazette Journal named him the most decorated Nevada-born Olympian ever in 2015.",

USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland announced all staff, athletes and facility workers are required to get their shots by Nov. 1 if they haven't already, in preparation for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. USOPC personnel must show proof of vaccination by Dec. 1, but exemptions will be awarded in certain medical and religious circumstances. Hirshland said the vaccination requirement will continue into every Olympic and Paralympic event going forward. No other American sports league has a COVID-19 vaccination mandate, although the NHL -- which will begin sending players to the Olympics ahead of Beijing 2022 -- enacted strict protocols such as allowing teams to suspend unvaccinated players if they miss time. The New York Islanders illustrated how serious the league is taking COVID-19 by banning an unvaccinated minor-leaguer from playing for the team. The International Olympic Committee along with most other national Olympic committees -- including the USOPC -- recommended but didn't require athletes participating in the 2020 Tokyo Games to get vaccinated. Still, the USOPC said 83% of its athletes were vaccinated while the IOC estimated 85% overall had their shots. \"The stark reality is that this pandemic is far from over,\" Hirshland wrote in a letter obtained by the Associated Press. \"This step will increase our ability to create a safe and productive environment for Team USA athletes and staff, and allow us to restore consistency in planning, preparation and service to athletes.\" Team USA plans to send nearly 240 athletes to the 2022 Winter Olympics, which are scheduled to start Feb. 4 and will likely have testing and social-distancing requirements akin to the ones Tokyo implemented for the Summer Games.",

Katie Ledecky, a 10-time Olympic medalist with seven golds, announced Wednesday she'll serve as a volunteer swimming coach at the University of Florida while training for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Gainesville. At Florida the 24-year-old Ledecky will reunite with Gators swimming coach Anthony Nesty, who served on Team USA's staff during the Tokyo Games. \"The knowledge and experience that Katie brings to the pool are unparalleled,\" Nesty said in a statement. \"In addition to her obvious excellence as a swimmer, Katie is an exceptional person who will make a great impact on the student-athletes here. Katie's values are in total alignment with the Florida program, and we're so excited to have her join the Gators as she continues to train for the 2024 Olympics.\" Ledecky, who earned her bachelor's degree in psychology from Stanford during June's Olympic Trials, brings a wealth of college experience and success to the Gators' staff. In only two years of collegiate swimming Ledecky won eight individual NCAA championships and powered the Cardinal to consecutive NCAA and Pac-12 titles from 2017-18. The three-time Olympian has dominated the international stage as much as college, winning the most medals of any female Team USA athlete in her last two appearances at the Games. Ledecky's seven gold medals in Olympic individual events are the most ever by a female Team USA athlete. \"I'm excited to be a part of the University of Florida's world-class swimming and diving program and train for the 2024 Olympics with Coach Anthony Nesty, and the top-tier mid-distance and distance training group,\" said Ledecky, who also cited Gainesville's proximity to her home in Maryland as a reason for the move. \"My years at Stanford, both academically and athletically, were nothing short of incredible and I'm looking forward to the opportunity and challenges that lie ahead in Gainesville.\" Ledecky has spent the last five years training at her alma mater under Team USA coach Greg Meehan. She'll now work with a 1988 Olympic gold medalist in Nesty and fellow Olympic medalists Bobby Finke and Kieran Smith, and she's amped for the challenge to compete with the men. \"I think I always benefit from training with the guys,\" Ledecky told USA Today, \"so I'll be able to do that very consistently down in Florida with athletes who have similar goals that I do to compete on the international level in those events. They have a very deep group of male distance and mid-distance swimmers and I'm really excited about that.\" Ledecky won't be the only Olympic superstar in Florida's pool. Fellow American Caeleb Dressel, a seven-time Olympic gold medalist who won a school-record 10 NCAA Championships with the Gators, also trains in Gainesville under coach Gregg Troy.",

  "body": "United States Olympic gymnasts Simone Biles and Aly Raisman were on hand on Wednesday to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee that FBI agents need to be held accountable for mishandling the investigation into former Team USA doctor Larry Nassar. According to a recent report published by the Department of Justice's inspector general, FBI agents didn't act with \"seriousness and urgency\" regarding reports of Nassar and his misconducts. The report found that FBI agents mishandled evidence and even made false statements to investigators relating to the case. \"It truly feels like the FBI turned a blind eye to us,\" Biles told the Senate on Wednesday. She added that the FBI agents in question need to be prosecuted and held fully accountable for their lack of action. Biles also questioned why the Department of Justice hasn't already handed out criminal charges to these FBI agents. During Wednesday's hearing, senators stated that a Justice Department official declined to speak regarding the investigation. Raisman informed the senators that it took 14 months for FBI agents to speak to her after the initial report of Nassar's sexual misconduct in 2015. That means that for more than a year after the initial report, Nassar was permitted to see patients. Dozens of young women were sexually assaulted during that time period. \"Why would duly sworn officers ignore reports of abuse across state lines?\" Raisman asked on Wednesday. Fellow American gymnast McKayla Maroney, like Raisman, brought up the timeline. \"By not taking action from my report they (the FBI) allowed a child molester to go free for more than a year. They had legal evidence of child abuse and did nothing,\" Maroney stated in her testimony. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz and FBI Director Christopher Wray also testified on Wednesday. Wray did acknowledge that the FBI agents were in the wrong and said that there were \"fundamental errors that occurred in 2015 and 2016 that should never have happened.\" Wray informed the senators that the FBI was altering its processes in order to make sure that a failure of this magnitude never happens again. When the first complaints were brought to the FBI's attention in 2015, Wray wasn't leading the FBI at that time. \"I'm deeply and profoundly sorry,\" Wray said \"...I'm especially sorry that there were people at the FBI who had their own chance to stop this monster in 2015 and failed. It never should have happened. And we're doing everything in our power to make sure it never happens again.\" Nassar is currently serving a 60-year prison sentence for child pornography charges, which is from police finding that material on his property in September 2016. In addition, Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in Michigan state court. That added 175 years to his prison sentence.",

This comes after United States track star Sha'Carri Richardson was disqualified from the Tokyo Olympics as a result of testing positive for marijuana use -- which she admitted using following the death of her mother. In a statement, WADA stated that the agency received many requests from \"a number of stakeholders\" asking to look further into the status of cannabis as a banned substance. This review will take place in 2022 and be conducted by the Prohibited List Expert Advisory Group within WADA. Until then, cannabis will still be banned in competition. The earliest that will change will be in 2022 after the review is over. In 2011, the WADA published a paper that stated that marijuana is banned because cannabis \"could potentially endanger\" athletes \"and others because of increased risk taking, slower reaction times and poor executive function or decision making.\" WADA also believes that cannabis can be \"performance enhancing\" for athletes. However, a 2018 study that was published in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine determined that there \"is no direct evidence of performance-enhancing effects in athletes.\" Richardson used marijuana in Oregon, a state where the substance is legal, after learning about the death of her biological mother. That was just weeks before the start of the Tokyo Olympics.",

  "body": "Long-distance runner Paul Chelimo became Team USA's first two-time Olympic medalist in the 5,000-meter event last month in Tokyo. But while Chelimo calls earning the medal an \"honor,\" the 30-year-old admits the Games were \"very intense\" and \"took a lot out of\" him. Chelimo's exhaustion was evident when he collapsed through the end line to finish just a fraction of a second ahead of Kenya's Nicholas Kipkorir Kimeli. The 40th annual New Balance Fifth Avenue Mile will be Chelimo's biggest step toward returning to form while also preserving his body. Chelimo will compete against 13 Tokyo Olympians, two Olympic medalists and two past event champions in the race slated for Sept. 12 in New York. \"I can't think of any road race in the world bigger than the Fifth Avenue Mile,\" said Chelimo, who'll be competing in first one-mile race since 2018. \"It's going to be on the weekend, it's always live on the TV, it's always in New York City -- and I know a lot of people in New York love running. So, that's where I want to be at this time. It should be fun being a part of it and it's hopefully not the last one. \"The goal is I hope I come back with a win.\" Chelimo has two motivating factors for the race. The first, meeting increasingly-high expectations from his fans and sponsors, has been around since he began running professionally. The second, however, is two years old and has given him a \"different drive.\" That second motivating factor is Arianna Chebet Chelimo, Chelimo's first child. \"When I go out there, I grind because she's got to live a better life,\" Chelimo said. \"She's got to have the best life.\" Chelimo wants his daughter to have the best life largely because his own -- prior to moving from Kenya to the U.S. to run collegiately in 2010 -- was far from it. In the 11 years since Chelimo's nearly 10,000-mile journey from his hometown of Itan, Kenya to the U.S., he's adopted the saying \"go hard or suffer the rest of your life.\" The words are ubiquitous across Chelimo's social media. Chelimo's mother instilled that \"go hard\" way of life into him as a child, and it's helped build him into the two-time Olympic medalist the world knows today. \"You always have to work hard for the best things,\" Chelimo said. \"And me coming to the U.S., it was really life-changing, and that's why I believe in 'go hard or suffer the rest of your life.' The United States is a land of opportunities and this is a place where, if you work really hard, everything is going to fall in place.\" \"I just have to go hard,\" he added. \"That's what I go with. The way I grew up, the only way I could get out of poverty and a tough life is just with my running. Running saved me.\" Running in the U.S. may have saved Chelimo, but he handsomely repaid the favor to his new country. Chelimo enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2014 and served as a water-treatment specialist. He gained U.S. citizenship just ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics for his service. The Army -- including its Word Class Athlete Program, which trains Olympic hopefuls such as Chelimo -- gave him a new mentality. A more respectful, humble, resilient and tough mentality. It's a mentality he carries into every race. \"You got to be resilient, you got to be tough,\" Chelimo said. \"And they teach you that, when you go to war, be ready to die for your country. So, that's the same way I feel when I wear the United States singlet. I feel like I'm representing the military in a different type of way.\" Chelimo's next big goal requires him to represent Team USA again. He's hoping to earn gold -- at age 38 -- in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Belief, Chelimo says, is what he's relying on to reach that goal. Belief has also gotten Chelimo to thrive after moving across the ocean, serving his country, succeeding at the Olympic level and providing for his daughter.

But Zolkefli's hopes were dashed after he ended up being disqualified for arriving late to the event. Three minutes late, to be exact. International Paralympics Committee Spokesman Craig Spence\u00a0told the Associated Press that Zolkefli arrived three minutes late to the event along with two other Malaysian competitors. \"They were late, they may have had a logical reason for being late, and therefore we allowed them to compete and look at the facts of the matter afterward,\" Spence said. World Para Athletics, which is the governing body for track and field Paralympics events, revealed that a referee determined \"there was no justifiable reason for the athletes' failure to report\" on time to the event. Zolkefli appealed the decision, but it was denied. As a result of the disqualification, Ukraine's Maksym Koval won the gold medal while Ukraine's Oleksandr Yarovyi earned the silver medal. Greece's Efstratios Nikolaidis took home the bronze medal. \"We are now seeing comments on all our social media posts that have nothing to do with the men's shot put F20 event,\" Spence said. \"I'm sorry.

Pagonis won America's first gold medal of the Tokyo Paralympics in the women's S11 400-meter freestyle while Pergolini placed first in the S13 100-meter backstroke. The first-time Paralympians can bask in their medal-winning glory together, as they've become fast friends while rooming together in Tokyo. \"I remember waking up this morning and [Pagonis] was like, 'This is the day, Gia. You got this,'\" Pergolini told NBC after her race. \"And I said, 'You got this too.' And we just love each other and love supporting each other.\" The Paralympians' mutual support led to two record-shattering performances. Pagonis broke the world record she set herself at the U.S. Paralympic Swimming Trials with a time of 4:54:49, 10 seconds faster than the silver medalist Lissette Bruinsma of the Netherlands. Pergolini broke her event's world record twice within a 10-hour span, first in her preliminary heat with a 1:05.05 and then again in the final with a 1:04.64. \"I'm so excited we're able to be here and we're both world-record holders,\" Pagonis, who completely lost her sight to genetic retina disease and autoimmune retinopathy at age 14, told the Olympic Information Service. Pagonis is competing in the S11 class, which is for Paralympians with the greatest visual impairments. Pergolini -- who began losing her sight to Stargardt disease as a kindergartener -- is classified as an S13 Paralympian, meaning she's visually impaired but not the extent of S11 and S12 athletes. After her record-breaking win, a dancing and medal-toting Pagonis posted a TikTok with the caption, \"My back hurting from carrying my gold medal.\" She has over two million followers on the social media platform. Pagonis can add to that weight on her back in these Paralympics as she's yet to compete in the 50-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle and the 200-meter individual medley. Pergolini is slated to race in the 50-meter freestyle.",

With the 15th gold medal of her career, Storey is now only one gold medal away from tying Mike Kenny's record mark of 16 gold medals in the Paralympics, which has stood since 1988. Storey, 43, has now medaled in eight of the games she has competed in, and her 27.057 time in qualifying broke the record she had set five years ago in Rio by over four seconds. \"I've  done so much training, and everyone's been reminding me how much work  I've done and how I deserve to be that fast, but you don't like to  presume. So it took me by surprise, but a good surprise,\" Storey said in a report by BBC Sport. \"I think about one race at a time and maybe I'll think about these things afterwards. But it does feel pretty surreal.\" Storey, who was born without a functioning left hand, first competed in the Paralympics as a swimmer in 1992, and remained in that discipline before switching to cycling in 2005. Storey has since won 10 gold medals in cycling to go with her five in swimming, including in 2012 when she won the individual pursuit, 500-meter time trial, time trial, and road race in her native England. Storey's next step towards Paralympic history will come Tuesday, when she competes in the C5 road time trial.",

For British powerlifter Ali Jawad, he had to take some serious extra precautions. Jawad, 32, ended up \"indirectly\" self-isolating for three years,\u00a0the told BBC, in preparation for the Tokyo Paralympics. The athlete has Crohn's disease and was, at one point not long ago, on the brink of death. Because of his immune system being compromised, Jawad decided to self-isolate as he hoped to make the Tokyo Paralympics. \"This is probably the most invested cycle I've ever had in terms of using every ounce of physical, mental and emotional energy just to even qualify,\" Jawad said. \"The last three or four years with my Crohn's and my health, it's been the hardest of my life.\" Just hours before competing at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics, Jawad was sick with flu-like symptoms and assumed it was a run-of-the-mill stomach bug. However, the symptoms got worse when he returned to the United Kingdom after the Games. That's when he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation of the digestive tract that can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. Jawad went on to compete at the London Games in 2012, where he finished fourth, and then won silver at the following Paralympics in Rio. In preparing for the Toyko Games, Jawad has had to be extremely careful because of his Chron's disease. He even said that whether or not the COVID-19 pandemic happened, he would've been forced to isolate as a result of his condition... because he already was. He chose to isolate and make his own food, as well as not see friends and family, as a way to manage Chron's disease before the pandemic started. COVID did add to his isolation time, as the Olympics and Paralympics were postponed for a year in 2020. Jawad said that helped his situation, though. \"I was never going to make it last year and the extra year allowed me to attempt to get fitter,\" Jawad added. Jawad has stated that this will be his last Paralympics due to the intense preparation that he had to go through.",

Xueying, who earned gold in trampoline gymnastics during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, posted photos to social media of her medal peeling off on the upper left-hand side. \"Let me clarify this\u2026 I didn't mean to peel the thing off at first, I just discovered that there was a small mark (like pic one) on my medal,\" Xueying wrote on the social-media website Sina Weibo, per the Global Times. \"I thought that it was probably just dirt, so I rubbed it with my finger and found that nothing changed, so then I picked at it and the mark got bigger.\" The Tokyo Olympic Games' Organizing Committee offered a rebuttal to the \"quality\" issue Xueying posed, telling the Global Times the material coming off the gymnast's medal was its protective coating instead of the actual gold plating. This coating is intended to protect the medals from stains and scratches and \"does not affect the quality of the medal itself,\" the Committee added. Medals awarded during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics contained metal from Japanese citizens' recycled electronic devices, an experimental practice comparable to the Jade-inlaid medals from the 2008 Beijing Games. Should Xueying need a replacement medal, she's in luck. The IOC keeps molds of all the Games' medal designs and offers replacements to Olympic winners for a fee. That foresight came in handy earlier this month when Japanese mayor Takashi Kawamura bit into the gold medal of softball pitcher Miu Goto, and -- after receiving over 8,000 complaints -- offered to pay for a replacement The 2020 Tokyo Olympics' medal maker, Japan Mint, told the Global Times it has yet to find any problems with gold-medal peeling. Still, it said the Tokyo Organizing Committee may open an investigation into the matter.",

  "body": "In the 2016 Rio Olympics, a then 19-year-old U.S. swimmer Lilly King burst onto the international stage by winning gold medals in the 4x100-meter medley and 100-meter breaststroke. She was the fourth youngest woman on a veteran-laden squad. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics, however, presented a new challenge to King: leadership. Because the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the Games a year, a new wave of U.S. swimmers entered the Olympic fray. The result: King could no longer get by as the self-described \"kid.\" \"I went from being the rookie to the vet so quickly,\" said King, who's older than 19 of her 26 Tokyo teammates. \"But in terms of my own success, it was again just a crazy meet. Obviously being pretty down after the (100-meter breaststroke) then being able to come back and do really well in the (200-meter breaststroke) was pretty cool. But yeah, it's exciting to see that I've been able to be super consistent throughout the last five years, which is something that's really hard to do.\" King bounced back from a bronze-medal finish in the 100-meter breaststroke -- an event she was favored to win -- to earn silver in the 200-meter breaststroke and 4x100-meter medley, helping the U.S. women earn a leading 18 swimming medals in Tokyo. Those two medals were far from King's only contributions. King made the \"seamless transition\" into a leader during the 2021 Games, helping first-time Olympians Lydia Jacoby (17), Claire Curzan (17), Torri Huske (18), Regan Smith (19) and Emma Weyant (19) all earn medals of their own. \"It was just kind of a crazy ride, and we all had to learn to navigate it together,\" King said. \"I think it turned out pretty well.\" King's next ride is the 2021 International Swimming League season, which will air on CBS and CBS Sports Network. You can catch the opening weekend Aug. 28 on CBS Sports Network and Aug. 29 on CBS, at noon ET each day. Her Cali Condors won the ISL Grand Final in 2020, the league's second year, and are hoping to defend their title in Naples, Italy, this fall. The Condors are led by a slew of 2020 Tokyo Olympics medalists in King, reigning ISL MVP Caeleb Dressel, Olivia Smoliga and Hali Flickinger. But despite their recent success in the Olympic pool, King emphasized that production won't directly translate to the ISL. Their team chemistry, however, will. \"It's definitely very different, different game, different scenario,\" King said. \"We got a lot of people returning from the team from last year, and we have a lot of fun together, honestly. We just win and goof off and train hard and swim fast, so it's a really great group of people, and we just build off that team chemistry and it usually works pretty well for us.\" While King is confident in the Condors' talent and camaraderie, she admits \"we were probably a little more hungry\" in their title-winning 2020 season compared to 2021. King plans to regain that hunger through her disdain for the competition. \"We just kind of hate the other teams,\" King said. \"We're really proud to be Condors, and we don't really get along that well with the other teams, to be honest. I think really that hatred of losing is what drives us.\" The ISL's regular season is slated for Aug. 26-Sept. 26 in Naples, Italy. King's Instagram-famous cat, Minnie, won't make the trip, but the 24-year-old Indiana native will be there with the positive attitude and newly-refined leadership skills responsible for her five Olympic medals and ISL championship. \"It's going to be fun,\" King said. \"That's kind of why we do this and why we swim. Just a lot of racing and a lot of fun for the athletes, and hopefully it's fun for the viewers as well.\"",

This was Richardson's first race since June's U.S. Olympic Trials, as she was suspended from the 2020 Tokyo Games for a positive marijuana test. Her highlight though, came in a post-race interview with NBC Sports, calling her return \"great\" -- and staking her claim as one of the world's top track-and-field athletes despite the disappointing finish.(Warning: NSFW language) \"I'm not upset with myself at all,\" Richardson said. \"This is one race. I'm not done. You know what I'm capable of. Count me out if you want to. Talk all the s--t you want because I'm here to stay. I'm not done. I'm the sixth-fastest woman in this game, ever, and can't nobody ever take that away from me. Congratulations to the winners. Congratulations to the people that won, but they're not done seeing me yet -- period.\" The Prefontaine Classic pitted Richardson against the three women's 100-meter medalists from Tokyo -- Jamaica's Elaine Thompson-Herah, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson -- along with fellow Americans Teahna Daniels and Javianne Oliver. Like in Tokyo, Thompson-Herah took gold, Fraser-Pryce won silver and Jackson took bronze. Daniels finished fourth while Oliver placed sixth. Richardson finished ninth with a 11.14, well below her personal-best of 10.72 -- the sixth-fastest time in the event's history -- and 10.86 from the Olympic Trials. Hours before those Olympic Trials, Richardson used marijuana to cope with the death of her mother. While USA Track and Field described the situation as \"incredibly unfortunate\" and \"devastating,\" it did not reverse Richardson's one-month suspension that would've allowed her to compete in the Tokyo Olympics. \"That sent me in a state of mind, in a state of emotional panic, if anything,\" Richardson said of her mother's passing. \"During all that, I still, even though I'm here, I still have to go out and put on a performance for my dream.\" While the 21-year-old Richardson struggled in the Prefontaine Classic, Thompson-Herah bolstered her growing legend. Thompson-Herah, who earned three gold medals (100-meter, 200-meter and 4x100-meter relay) in Tokyo,\u00a0 posted the second-fastest women's 100 meters time in history with a 10.54. Florence Griffith Joyner's world record of 10.49 has stood since 1988. To Thompson-Herah, her best is still yet to come. \"I ran 10.5 [today] and I think I have so much more in me,\" Herah told NBC Sports.",

Russian-born athletes competed under the Russian Olympic Committee name at the 2020 Games due to penalties Russia was handed after it was discovered the country was running a doping program. Russian lawmaker Aleksei Zhuravlyov,\u00a0according to The Daily Beast, described other competing countries at the Games as \"a pack of Russophobic beasts, headed by the United States.\" On Monday, Olga Skabeeva, who is a television host on Russia's state-owned television channel, echoed those statements, saying on the air that the Summer Games were the \"clearest example of total Russophobia.\" \"These Olympic Games stink,\" Skabeeva said. \"Global sports forever ceased being an honest competition, turning into a cheap political farce. At the behest of Americans, the International Olympic Committee took away two gold medals from Russian.\" Skabeeva didn't provide any evidence to support her claims, but that didn't stop other from agreeing with the claims. \"Americans are freaks. Moral freaks. Why are we even discussing this parade of freaks and perverts?\" deputy speaker of the Russian State Duma Pyotr Tolstoy added, the Daily Beast reported. Oleg Matveychev, who is a member of the Russian Expert Institute for Social Research, referenced Russian gymnast Dina Averina's loss in the rhythmic gymnastics all-around competition as an event that was fixed. Israel's Linoy Ashram won the gold medal in the event, even after the Russian team asked for that victory to be overturned. Matveychev claimed that Ashram's gold medal should've been take away because she dropped the ribbon during her final exercise. He claimed that it would've been impossible for her to win. Ironically, Averina of Russia dropped her ribbon at the 2018 world championship, but still managed to win a gold medal.",

They were training wherever they could, in the parks and back gardens,\"\u00a0Sadiqi said, according to Reuters. \"This would have been the first female Afghan taekwondo player to take part.

On Monday the New Jersey native added another line to her increasingly-stacked resume: her own footwear and apparel collection. The \"New Balance x Sydney Signature Collection\" -- which features everything from warm-up ponchos to jumpsuits and sneakers, all intended to support performance and fashion -- is \"very authentic to who I am and the message I want to get across.\" New Balance openly received McLaughlin and her message during the design and styling process. \"From the first meeting to the final approval process Syd has been so engaged in bringing this to life,\" New Balance apparel designer Rachel Walder said in a statement. \"Her drive on the track easily transitioned to the design of this collection. We know this is just the beginning for Syd and we're excited to play a part in her journey on and off the track.\" McLaughlin's journey to stardom garnered national attention during the 2016 Rio Olympics, when she became the youngest U.S. track and field Olympian ever at age 17. That would be far from the only record she'd go on to break. In June's Olympic trials, McLaughlin became the first woman to shatter the 52-second barrier in the women's 400-meter hurdles by finishing in 51.90. She then bested that world-record time by a whopping 44 tenths of a second to win the event's gold medal in Tokyo. McLaughlin also took home gold in the women's 4x400-meter relay in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, a win that gave fellow American Allyson Felix her record 11th medal. That experience was \"amazing\" and \"really special\" for McLaughlin, who idolized the five-time Olympian Felix since she was roughly eight years old. Despite being atop her sport, McLaughlin continues her strive to improve thanks to her \"be the first you\" motto -- one prominently featured in the \"New Balance x Sydney Signature Collection.\" Her symbol for the motto is a butterfly. To McLaughlin, butterflies represent \"the idea of evolving into your true version of yourself, who you're meant to be.\" The athlete McLaughlin is meant to be, in her view, has yet to arrive. \"I think it's just the idea of constantly wanting to improve,\" McLaughlin said. \"I've never had a perfect race. I think there's so much growth for me to attain. My coach and I are constantly just pushing the boundaries for myself and really striving in every single race to be better than I was before. It's been really cool, kind of just my personal progression to strive to be better and better every time I step on the track.\"",

According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Richardson is among the confirmed participants for the Prefontaine Classic at the University of Oregon. Richardson is expected to compete in the 100- and 200-meter races. \"Sha'Carri is focused on running a good race since she last competed at  the US Olympic Trials,\" Renaldo Nehemiah, Richardson's agent, told the Journal. \"She will be focused on executing her race to the  best of her ability regardless of who is in the race.\" Richardson's participation in the Classic comes following a month-long suspension by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after she tested positive for marijuana after winning the 100-meters at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June. The infraction cost Richardson a place on the U.S. Track and Field team for the Olympics. In the Prefontaine Classic, Richardson will go up against the Jamaican trio of 100-meter medalists from Tokyo: Olympic record holder and gold medalist Elaine Thompson-Herah headlines that group, which also includes Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson.

In addition to Parchment himself, the Jamaican government is also set to reward Trijana. According to a report by The Gleaner, Trijana is now being invited to Jamaica by the government's Ministry of Tourism. \"It is selfless what she did; one would not know what the outcome would have been,\" said Edmund Bartlett of the Ministry of Tourism. \"No matter where in the world she is, we want to reciprocate the kindness shown to one of our own.\" Parchment ended up prevailing in the 110m hurdles in an event which saw Jamaican athletes take two of three places on the podium.

German Olympic Sports Federation president Alfons Hoermann slammed the rules barring rider-horse bonding in a press conference on Saturday. According to a translation from The Guardian, Hoermann said the international equestrian rules require an \"urgent overhaul.\" \"The numerous occasions at the competition yesterday, from literally the first to the last rider, are, we believe, unacceptable,\" Hoermann said. \"They endanger animal welfare and therefore damage the reputation of the sport and the sports men and women.\" Germany, Hoermann's home country, was directly involved in the Olympic pentathlon drama. The German coach Kim Raisner punched Saint Boy, fellow German Annika Schleu's horse, before it entered the arena. Saint Boy then refused to jump, causing Schleu, the medal contender in the Olympic event, to burst into tears and finish 31st. Raisner was banned from the Games for her actions. Earlier in the competition, Saint Boy refused to allow the Russian Olympic Committee's Gulnaz Gubaydullina to ride him. International Modern Pentathlon Union president Klaus Schormann rallied against the criticism, claiming a few \"not so nice\" moments shouldn't detract from the \"absolutely excellent\" horses and \"high quality\" facilities. To Schormann, the athletes -- not the horses -- were at fault for their struggles in the pentathlon. \"We tested them and they were well prepared, and there is no basis for athletes to complain,\"\u00a0Schormann told the Irish Examiner. \"It is only because of the athletes themselves if they were not successful in some parts of the competition.\" The modern pentathlon's governing body, the UIPM, said it would undertake a \"full review of the Riding discipline of the Women's Modern Pentathlon at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games\" in a statement.",

  "body": "The Olympics are about dreams. Decades of falling asleep thinking about ... what? Slipping a piece of fabric that loops through a heavy gold disc around your neck? Entering the stadium with 10,000 people rumbling your name? The ecstasy of experiencing competition with another at a level so deep and so unrecognizable that it plays out not in a pool but in one's soul? What is the cost of these dreams, though? For most, it is in the past. The hours that were inputted, the opportunities that were forgone, the relationships that were paused. The two-week stretch in Tokyo with the curtain drawn to the world is the end of that cost. It is the payoff, or a portion of it. That's the joy you see on so many faces. The delight that perhaps the sacrifice was worthy. For some, though, what has been paid in the past pales in comparison to what will come due for the rest of their lives. When you are historically great, you never escape people wanting you to do the thing that made them feel the way they felt that one time you did it so memorably. Even if they don't say it to you, that is the eternal subtext. Swim like you did in Beijing, Michael. Play like you did at Augusta, Tiger. Dunk like you did when you were 23, Vince. I read a haunting quote last week from one of the preeminent athletes at these Summer Games. It was uttered in the wake of a week-long competition that thrives on drama, rivalry and numbers measured by the hundredth. Here is the quote: \"The sport was a lot more fun when no one knew my name, to be honest.\" Who do you think said that? You might think it was Novak Djokovic, Naomi Osaka or Simone Biles, all of whom exited earlier than expected at these Games. All very famous athletes -- all struggling with the mental and physical consequences of being very famous athletes. This is a conversation almost exclusive to those who have The Gift. The ones with talents nearly beyond their own ability to tend to them. This is not to say that the most gifted do not work hard because, in fact, if they did not work as hard or harder than anyone then we would never know they had The Gift to begin with. So few receive The Gift, even fewer do something with it. The Gift begets success and success begets fame. Fame begets everything else, including, insidiously so at these Olympic Games, the weight of expectations. The cost of these dreams for those with The Gift is the expectation not that the experience would be wonderful for you but that you would make it wonderful for me. Never has it been easier to hear that drumbeat that, I suspect, has always existed. Never has it been harder to tune it out. The burden of that is more than anyone was ever meant to bear. Caeleb Dressel, arguably the most decorated athlete at these Olympics, uttered the quote above. Its biggest star. The one whose fame and renown changed the most from two weeks ago. The most successful by the standards of most people in the world. The implication here should be obvious: sport and competition are fun, manifesting Atlas is not. In my country, there are two currencies. I don't know the cultural nuances of other countries, but in the United States you either deal in fame or you deal in money. Both can be spent to consolidate power. Those are, presumably, what everyone is after as a gateway to happiness and peace, and the ones with The Gift usually receive oodles of both. Yet how rarely do those who achieve what we all say we want to achieve find happiness and peace? I cover golf, so I always think of Tiger Woods when I think of The Gift. I think of the story -- perhaps apocryphal, but nonetheless the absolute perfect description of his life -- about his answer to why he enjoyed going out on his boat, named Privacy (!), so much. He apparently said because when you stare at all the fish, none of them stare back at you. The Gift, it turns out, comes with a curse. Fame is ostensibly one of the benefits of success, but the cold reality seems to be that the weight of it is actually its greatest cost. There's a famous Jim Carrey quote about fame. Many of you have probably heard it, but it doesn't get talked about enough. It doesn't get posted as a warning sign to our wide-eyed 17-year-olds enough: \"I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it's not the answer.\" Damn. The No. 1 story from the Tokyo Olympics was those who did not participate. I am extremely disinterested in the micro-tentacles of Simone Biles' decision to withdraw from the gymnastics competition altogether. There is a time and a place to dissect such decisions, and a world in which only those who enter the arena have authority to critique is both ridiculous and undesirable for all. There are, however, so many nuances to her specific situation and, broadly speaking, she deserves all the benefit of the doubt in the world given both her history and the circumstances. What I am interested in is the creation of a culture in which this could be (and will be) commonplace. That's the conversation here. If you think Biles should have persevered because -- what is the ubiquitous narrative here? -- that's what American athletes do, by golly (!), then maybe this is a conversation for you. I think about Biles going to Rio in 2016, a teenager with immense hopes. Much has happened since then, and all of it can be summed up in what Padraig Harrington, of all people, said at the 2021 PGA Championship. In golf circles, we have gone back to this quote so many times over the last few months: \"People often ask, in a general term, about experience. Well, as you gain experience, you lose innocence. I suppose if you drew a graph, there's a crossing point of equilibrium where you have some experience and a certain amount of innocence and enthusiasm. As you get a little bit older and you get all this experience, on paper people might think you get better with experience. But as I said, you've seen a few things that you know in your game that you probably never wanted to see, so you kind of lose that little bit of, I suppose, innocence. It's not everything it's cracked up to be to have experience.\" Biles, more or less, said the same thing last week about the time before the time when everyone knew her name. She was talking about the details of her sport (and so was Harrington), but it doesn't take a huge leap to apply the same principle to what happens outside of it. \"I'm a little bit more scared of my skills now,\" Biles said. \"Because whenever I was younger, I was pretty fearless. But now I'm just like, 'Okay, I'm getting older. This could go wrong, this could go wrong, that could do this.' And so, that kind of scares me a little bit.\" Innocence should be protected at all costs within an athlete's world. If you are a manager or an agent or a coach, it is the most valuable asset you can manage because it is the most fleeting. \"The sport was a lot more fun when no one knew my name.\" There are many angles to this problem. The internet has exacerbated everything. Our identities become wrapped up in who other people say that we are. We have bequeathed the base, human question, \"Will I be loved?\" to folks who have no authority on the matter. We want all information at all times in all places on all devices without considering either the monetary or cultural costs. We are reaping what others have sown. Some of this is on those with The Gift. You don't have to be on Instagram or do the P&G ads or the \"Today With Hoda & Jenna\" interviews. But stiff-arming the spotlight can feel like trying to stop an avalanche with a snow shovel. Given the tiny window you have to cash in, I'm sure it can feel unwise. Never has it been more demanding to be a world-class athlete. You have to do the thing that you do better than anyone else, but then you are also expected to do 25 other things that you were not trained to do -- and do them well every single day with almost no reprieve. I think a lot about a quote from Rory McIlroy's uncle in this great Golf Digest cover story by Jaime Diaz. Rory is another of those with The Gift, and he has warred with himself about how to handle it for a long time. \"Time has become his most precious commodity,\" said Brian McIlroy. \"He is absolutely delighted on those days when there is nothing he has to do.\" The sport was a lot more fun when no one knew my name. I don't know what we do here. I think we're in too deep. I am part of the problem. We all have a part in it. I desire a healthier path forward for us as a society and for those who are toddlers but have already been predisposed with The Gift. I don't want future Michael Phelps' to contemplate suicide because the gravity around them is heavier than it should be. There's a great proverb from the Bible (Proverbs 30:8) that could apply to all of this and to our path forward: \"Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me \u2026\" Give me neither poverty nor riches. Who among us is brave enough, is humble enough to ask for such a thing? In so many instances, I am not. For most athletes that competed at the Tokyo Games, the cost of these dreams ended on Sunday. That's it. For some \u2013 a handful or so with The Gift \u2013 they will steal away and try to wriggle out of it. Maybe they will retire and come back later in a different role, like Phelps has done. Maybe they feel stuck. Maybe they will re-enter the grind. For as much joy and wonder and gold as the Olympics brings, it also brings a sliver of sadness. Because though most have paid the price and received their reward in Tokyo, for some the cost of these dreams can feel like it has no end.",

  "body": "Happy Monday everyone, Shanna McCarriston back with tons of news from the sports world. Hope you had a wonderful weekend and enjoyed the final events of the Olympics. Last night was the Pro Football Hall of Fame ceremony and I loved watching highlights of the players in the 2021 class and listening to stories from their careers. I grew up watching Peyton Manning play (many times losing to Tom Brady \ud83d\ude04) so it felt wild to see him secure his place in football history. We will talk about the ceremony more in today's newsletter, but before we get to that, we have some other stuff to discuss, such as the top Olympic moments, Lionel Messi and more. Let's get to it. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics have come and gone, and they brought us some incredible moments from the top athletes around the world. The United States took home the most medals of any country with 113. Team USA combined for 39 gold, 41 silver and 33 bronze. China took home the second-most with 88, while host country Japan finished the Games with 58. There were many incredible Team USA moments to choose from as the best, and here are just a few: One of my favorite moments was easily the women's basketball team winning their seventh gold medal. Dominance in any sport is difficult enough, but it's especially hard when you are going against the best in the world. Simply put, Team USA always finds a way to win. Bird and Taurasi making history by becoming the first basketball players, man or woman, to win five Olympic gold medals is the icing on the cake. For full commentary on all the top moments, click here. Lionel Messi\u00a0has said his goodbyes to Barcelona and is now likely headed to Paris Saint-Germain. Messi's time with Barcelona, the only club he's played for, ended with an emotional press conference this past weekend. He discussed what the city and team meant to him, and did so through many tears. The superstar is now reportedly headed to play with PSG, according to CBS Sports' Fabrizio Romano -- who in great detail explained how Messi's split with Barcelona happened. Here is a look at the proposed details of his new contract: Some details still remain to be seen, as an official agreement has not been made yet. Last year, Messi revealed he wanted to leave Barcelona, which was the beginning of the end of his time with the club. His contractual situation was never settled due to La Liga salary cap issues, which led to this, but clearly he was not totally emotionally ready to leave Barcelona. Tom Brady is not thrilled with his fellow players. He said so much over the weekend,\u00a0calling them \"ignorant\" on social media. The defending champion seemed to be upset that the NFL's salary cap went down, even though the value of every team in the league increased by an average of 14% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the current salary cap is set at $182.5 million -- a 20% decrease. The team with the biggest increase in value? None other than Brady's Buccaneers, whose value went up by 29%. Here's what Brady's problem with all of this is, in his own words: Strong words from Brady, who would likely want to see the NFLPA negotiate a better collective bargaining agreement in the future. Ultimately, the seven-time champion isn't thrilled that the owners seem to be getting a better deal from the players, but as CBS Sports' John Breech pointed out, it's not that clear cut. Salary cap goes hand-in-hand with total revenue, which went down $4 billion during the coronavirus pandemic. Owners could counter argue that they took those losses while players got what they were promised. Regardless, the cap likely will increase from now on, with a 2022 cap going as high as $208.2, a 14% increase over 2021, the league announced. College Football Hall of Fame coach Bobby Bowden died at 91 on Sunday. Just weeks ago, the Florida State legend announced that he was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Bowden's son, Terry Bowden, later confirmed that his father had pancreatic cancer. Bowden's time with Florida State football -- all 34 years --elevated the program beyond measure in Tallahassee. Here's a snapshot of his 40-year career as a major college coach: Following his death this weekend,\u00a0friends, family, players and fans expressed their condolences for the coach on social media. \u26be Reds vs. Indians, 6:10 p.m.\u00a0|\u00a0CLE +150 | TV: MLB.TV \u26be White Sox vs. Twins, 8:10 p.m.\u00a0|\u00a0MIN +170 | TV: ESPN \u26be Yankees vs. Royals, 8:10 p.m. | KC +157 | TV: MLB.TV As someone who started watching football in 2001 at the young age of six, Peyton Manning was a face I watched for my entire childhood. Sometimes I watched him with hatred (those six times he beat Brady and the Patriots), sometimes I thanked him for his interceptions in Foxboro or on the road (the 11 times he was defeated by Bill Belichick's crew) and sometimes I watched him and laughed when he was in commercials or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" No matter what, though, I always watched him with respect, even as a rival to my hometown team. Watching his Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinement, with his rival-turned-friend Brady in his personal section, felt like a culmination of the time I started to love football. He joked that Brady won't retire until 2035, referencing how the 44-year-old just doesn't ever seem to be nearing his career. It was great to watch two GOATs interact and laugh on a stage like the HoF's.",

  "body": "The 2020 Tokyo Olympics are a wrap, and these Games were definitely ones to remember. Established stars such as Katie Ledecky and Kevin Durant delivered on their sky-high expectations while new ones emerged in first-time Team USA Olympians Sydney McLaughlin, Suni Lee and more. Allyson Felix became the most decorated track and field Olympian in U.S. history by winning her 11th career medal while swimmer Caeleb Dressel collected an impressive five golds in Tokyo. The U.S. also swept the men's and women's golf and basketball competitions. Overall, the U.S. claimed an Olympics-leading 113 medals (39 gold, 41 silver, 33 bronze). COUNTRY GOLD SILVER BRONZE TOTALS United States 39 41 33 113 China 38 32 18 88 Japan 27 14 17 58 Great Britain 22 21 22 65 Russian Olympic Committee 20 28 23 71 Here are our top 10 memories from Tokyo. In the women's 200m final, Katie Ledecky shockingly placed fifth -- her worst ever Olympic finish -- and more than a half second out of medal position. The now 10-time Olympic medalist (seven gold, three silver) emphatically rebounded just over an hour later. Ledecky (15:37.34) dominated the Olympics' first ever women's 1500m final, finishing more than four seconds faster than her fellow American and silver medalist Erica Sullivan (15:41.41). Germany's Sarah Kohler earned bronze with a time of 15:42.91. The 24-year-old Ledecky finished her 2020 Tokyo Olympics campaign with four medals. \"I've gained perspective over the years,\" Ledecky said. \"I've really learned a lot over the years. The times (in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics) might not be my best times, but I'm still really, really happy that I have a gold medal around my neck right now.\" After the \"twisties\" forced Simone Biles to withdraw from four gymnastics finals, a return from the two-time Olympian looked unlikely. But in typical Biles fashion, she rose to glory when it mattered most. Biles delivered a 14.000 in the women's balance beam final to earn her second consecutive Olympic bronze in the event. China's Guan Chenchen and Tang Xijing finished 1-2 with scores of 14.633 and 14.233, respectively. Biles, who also won silver in this year's team competition, is now a seven-time Olympic medalist (four gold, one silver, two bronze). \"I'm proud of myself for the way I pushed through and even learned that dismount that I haven't done in years,\" Biles told the \"TODAY\" show. \"And just put up a good set, that's all I really wanted. I wasn't expecting to walk away with a medal or anything, I just wanted to go out there and do it for myself. And I did.\" As expected, an American won the women's 100m breaststroke. The unexpected: it wasn't the reigning Olympic gold medalist Lilly King. Lydia Jacoby, a 17-year-old Alaskan, stunned the pool and viewing audience by finishing ahead of both King (1:05.54) and South Africa's Tatjana Schoenmaker (1:05.22) to win gold. The win by Jacoby gave Alaska its first ever Olympic swimming medal. When Jacoby also took home silver in the 4x100m medley relay, she joined alpine skier Tommy Moe as the only Alaskans to win more than one medal in a single Olympics. \"It was crazy,\" Jacoby said. \"I was definitely racing for a medal. I knew I had it in me, but I wasn't really expecting a gold medal. When I looked up at the scoreboard, it was insane.\" In the lead-up to these Olympics, 24-year-old Caeleb Dressel was considered a potential successor to the GOAT -- otherwise known as Michael Phelps. Dressel lived up to the hype in his very first race of the 2021 Games. In the men's 4x100m freestyle, Dressel led the U.S. to gold by swimming a blazing-fast time of 47.26 as the first leg. The Americans finished with third-fastest time ever in the event, a 3:08.97, while Italy (3:10.11) and Australia (3:10.22) finished second and third, respectively. Dressel eventually won four additional golds in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. \"I felt good the whole way, I knew I had to get my hand in the wall first and get some clean water,\" Dressel said. \"And everyone did their job. It's a relay for a reason, it's four guys for a reason, it's certainly not just me. It's certainly not just one guy.\" When the reigning gold medalist Biles withdrew from the women's all-around competition, she opened the door for a new champion. Fellow American and first-time Olympian Suni Lee took full advantage. The 18-year-old Lee collected her first gold medal with a score of 57.433, above the silver medalist Rebeca Andrade (57.298) of Brazil and Angeline Melnikova (57.199) of the Russian Olympic Committee. Lee, who came into these Games as the first ever Hmong-American Olympic gymnast, made additional history by becoming the ethnic group's first medalist. \"I really want to be an inspiration to others and help others reach their dreams,\" Lee told the \"TODAY\" show. An opening group play loss to France marred the Americans' start to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but Team USA left the Games with exactly what it wanted: its fourth consecutive gold medal. Kevin Durant contributed a team-leading 29 points along with six rebounds and three assists in a rematch with France in the men's basketball final, an 87-82 victory for the Americans, earning his third gold. Only Carmelo Anthony -- who Durant passed on Team USA's all-time scoring list in these Games -- has as many golds as Durant now among all-time men's basketball Olympians. Jayson Tatum added 19 points -- on an efficient 8-of-14 shooting -- and a team-high seven rebounds in the final. \"I know it seems as if it's come easy for so long, but I played in 2016 and it wasn't easy then and it wasn't easy this year,\" Team USA's Draymond Green said. \"Don't get me wrong, I don't take either one of them for granted, but this one just feels a lot sweeter.\" The women's 400m hurdle featured eight athletes, but most eyes were only on two: Americans Sydney McLaughlin and reigning gold medalist Dalilah Muhammad. Muhammad and McLaughlin came into the event in a tier of their own, with the two women setting the last two world records in the event. The pair continued their record-breaking trend in Tokyo, adding the second and third ever sub-52 second finishes by a woman in the event's history. McLaughlin earned gold with a time of 51.46 while Muhammad earned silver with a 51.58. At 21, McLaughlin became the youngest women's 400m hurdles Olympic gold medalist ever. \"I saw Dalilah ahead of me with one to go,\" McLaughlin said. \"I just thought 'Run your race'. \"The race doesn't really start till hurdle seven and I just wanted to go out there and give it everything I had.\" Less than a week after Xander Schauffele gave the U.S. its first men's gold medal in golf since 1900, Nelly Korda did the same on the women's side. Korda posted a 17-under 267 to secure a one-shot victory over Japan's Mone Inami and Australia's Lydia Ko, who each posted 16-under 268s. Inami bested Ko in a playoff to earn silver. Korda, the world's top-ranked golfer, battled rainy conditions in Tokyo for her eventual victory. In addition to her Olympic success, Korda has three LPGA wins to her name this year. \"It's tough to win out here and she makes it look easy,\" said Jessica Korda, Nelly's sister and fellow competitor in the Tokyo Games. \"But these girls are good. Look at the leaderboard every week. This is how it is. So for her to be doing what she's doing is insane to me. But at the same time, it's so cool. This is like total G.O.A.T. status for me.\" Allyson Felix came into the women's 4x400m relay final with a chance at passing fellow American Carl Lewis for the most track and field medals ever by an American athlete, and she accomplished exactly that. Team USA -- led by Sydney McLaughlin, Felix, Dalilah Muhammad and Athing Mu -- won gold with a season-best time of 3:16.85. Poland (3:20.53) and Jamaica (3:21.24) finished with silver and bronze, respectively. The win gave Felix her record 11th medal, a storybook ending to the career of one of the most prolific Olympians ever. \"It's an amazing group of women right here,\" McLaughlin said. \"Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I think we all just knew going in it was going to be fast. All we had to do is do our part and just have fun with it.\" Brittney Griner missed only four of her 18 shots in a dominant 30-point, three-block performance against Japan, helping Team USA collect a 90-75 win in the women's basketball gold medal game. Her 30 points set a women's gold-medal game record. This was Team USA's seventh consecutive gold medal with Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi being a part of the last five, making them the most decorated basketball players in Olympic history. This is likely the final Olympics for Bird -- who confirmed she won't be back for Paris 2024 -- and Taurasi -- who indicated she will not return -- and they couldn't have asked for a better finish. \"There's always a lot of pressure when you put this jersey on,\" Taurasi said. \"I think you learn a lot about yourself when you play with the national team. It's always a collection of 12 of the best players in the world and you have to set yourself aside and come together to win, and it's not easy and it comes in different forms but we always find a way to do that and do it with class and team first. It's pretty amazing. It teaches you a lot about yourself and other people.\"",

Overall, 339 medals were handed out across 33 sports and Team USA was the big winner collecting one third of all of the medals that were awarded.

  "subtitle": "How's this for company: Ledecky has more individual gold medals than any swimmer in history except Michael Phelps",
  "author": "Matt Norlander",
  "date": "8/8/2021",

  "section": null,
  "body": "One of the most preposterous streaks in sports remained active Saturday morning in Tokyo: Katie Ledecky is undefeated in every 800-meter freestyle race she's competed in for 11 years. The most dominant female swimmer in history cemented her status and immortalized her legend in her final race of 2021 with her signature discipline. Ledecky touched the wall in 8:12.57, giving her the sixth individual gold and 10th Olympic medal of her career. Her six individual gold medals are now the most by any female U.S. Olympian ever and second-most in swimming to one person: Michael Phelps may forever hold an untouchable number with 13. But for as phenomenal as Phelps' five-Olympiad career was, it's Ledecky who commands a dominance in certain parts of swimming we've simply never seen before. Her supremacy specifically in the 800-meter freestyle might represent the most inevitable any athlete has been at anything ... ever? Sounds like hyperbole? It's not. It's not that she always wins, it's that she has defined the parameters of what success is in the women's 800-meter freestyle. Ledecky owns\u00a0the 22 best times in the history of the event. This is obscene authority. Her latest gold also meant achieving a three-peat in the 800 free. It marks just the fourth time in history a swimmer has won gold in an individual discipline in three consecutive Olympics. (Phelps' four straight in the 200-meter individual medley has never been matched.) Saturday's 8:12.57 pace was ho-hum by Ledecky standards; it was merely the 16th-fastest time she's logged. Ledecky, 24, beat out rival Ariarne Titmus, 20, who was not the same swimmer in the 800 as she was when Titmus beat Ledecky earlier in the week in the 200- and 400-meter freestyles. The Aussie hung close the entire race but never truly threatened Ledecky. Titmus touched in 8:13.83. Consider this: Titmus' silver-winning swim on Saturday was the fastest non-Ledecky time in the history of the women's 800-meter freestyle. It barely bested the 23rd-best time of Ledecky's career. Laughable! And now these two will almost certainly get to meet again in three years, when the Games will head to Paris. With that, it's likely\u00a0there will be no bigger storyline for the 2024 Summer Olympics than Ledecky vs. Titmus. That's right: Ledecky's Olympic career isn't over. While there wasn't too much speculation over this, it's nonetheless news that Ledecky went on record for the first time at these Games to state she is not retiring. \"That was not my last swim -- I'm at least going to '24,\" Ledecky said on NBC. \"Maybe '28, we'll see. But I knew [the 800] was going to be my last swim here. You never take anything for granted, you don't know if you're going to be back at the next Olympics, so just try to soak it all in.\" Ledecky and Titmus wound up splitting their four head-to-head meets in Tokyo, with Titmus taking gold in the 200 and 400 free, while Ledecky won in the 800 free and easily cruised in the first-ever Olympic 1,500-meter freestyle for women. (Titmus did not swim in that event.) In the 4x200 free relay, Ledecky swam the fastest leg (1:53.76) of any swimmer to lift the U.S. to a silver -- and edge Titmus and the Australians (bronze) in the process. \"It's awesome,\" Ledecky said on NBC. \"I just wanted to finish on a really good note, and I'm just so happy.\" With Ledecky's Tokyo action now complete, a recap of what she went through in a six-day stretch. These are only the finals; we're not even accounting for the prelims and semifinal heats she had to swim in as well. No swimmer logged more laps in the pool in Tokyo than Ledecky. Four medals in a six-day span. Ledecky was the only swimmer to compete in a \"sprint\" race (the 200 free) and the 1,500. Think of it this way: You don't see track athletes compete in the 100- or 200-meter dash and also run the 1,500, or 5,000, or 10,000 meters. She's different from any Olympian we've ever watched. It's been Ledecky's successes, in addition to her not taking gold in two of the five events she competed in, that's helped remind us that Olympic greatness can be about transcendent dominance -- but also shortcomings that humanize these athletes. An important facet of the Olympics is that they allow for non-binary results (not just one winner and all losers, but three medals to hand out) and make sports fans -- American sports fans in particular -- reconsider what elite achievement is. Katie Ledecky is not undefeated in the pool; no one ever is. But she's special and unlike anyone we've seen before. She's beatable, but she's unique. And with this showing in Tokyo -- two more golds, two more silvers -- Ledecky has unequivocally elevated herself to her own tier of Olympic greatness. She didn't need to sweep and take five golds to get there. A lesson to be applied. The best part is it's not over. Ledecky wasn't the force of nature in Tokyo that she was in Rio in 2016, which was clearly her peak. But in the presence of a true foil in Titmus, and with a race regimen that was viciously grueling, Ledecky proved she has no analog.",

After going undefeated in the group stage, Team USA took care of Australia in the quarterfinal round and blew out Serbia by 20 points in the semifinals. Now, they'll face Japan in the gold medal game (Saturday, 10:30 p.m. ET on NBC) to try and capture its seventh-straight gold medal. France and Serbia will face off for the bronze medal. There was a slight concern entering the tournament, as the Americans dropped a rare exhibition game prior to the start of the Olympics against an Australian team without its best player, Liz Cambage.

A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics nearing a conclusion, Tierney has analyzed Saturday's USA vs. Japan gold medal matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 basketball odds and betting trends for Japan vs. USA: USA is the most talented team in the field and it shows in the results. After a nine-point win in the opener, the Americans have won every game by double figures, including back-to-back wins by at least 20 points during the knockout stage. Team USA has size, athleticism and physicality that no opponent can match, and the Americans proved earlier in the tournament that they can handle Japan's playing style on the way to a 17-point win. Team USA has won an amazing 54 straight games in Olympic play, and is aiming for its seventh straight gold medal. On top of that, Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi are looking to become the first basketball players to win five gold medals, and the United States hasn't lost a game at the Olympics since 1992 in Barcelona. Japan is dangerous due to its shooting and passing prowess, but the Americans are heavy favorites for a reason. Japan is a strong offensive team that is dangerous against any opponent. It is tied for the tournament scoring lead at 83.6 points per game, and Japan is leading the entire field in 3-pointers (13.0 per game), 3-point attempts (31.8 per game) and 3-point percentage (40.9 percent). Some of that effectiveness stems from raw shooting talent, but Japan is also an elite passing team. The Japanese average 23.6 assists per game as a team, taking advantage of fantastic ball movement and player movement, and Japan also has the fewest turnovers (10.6 per game) in the field. Rui Machida is the embodiment of Japan's offensive attack, and she is lapping the entire field in averaging 13.8 assists per game during the Olympics. Machida generates 5.3 assists for every turnover she commits and, when compared to the United States, Japan's ball security could be huge. Team USA is averaging the second-most turnovers (17.8 per game) in the entire field, and that could swing things in Japan's direction. Tierney is leaning under on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the Team USA vs. Japan spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball predictions at SportsLine. So who wins the USA vs. Japan in the gold medal game for women's basketball? And which side of the Japan vs. USA spread is a must-back? Visit SportsLine now to get Mike Tierney's predictions for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, all from the renowned sportswriter who's covered nine Olympics in person and cashed big in both 2016 and '18, and find out.",

  "body": "The United States men's basketball team has won the gold medal after defeating France, 87-82, avenging the loss Team USA suffered in the opening game of group play. It is the fourth straight Olympic gold for the Americans. As he has been for the majority of the tournament, Kevin Durant was spectacular for Team USA as he finished the win with 29 points to go along with six rebounds and three assists. Jayson Tatum stepped up to provide Durant with the most help on the offensive end, finishing with 19 points to join Damian Lillard and Jrue Holiday as double-digit scorers as the guards finished the game with 11 points apiece. Team USA is coached by San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who is the successor to Mike Krzyzewski. Popovich previously won a bronze medal as an assistant coach under Larry Brown at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Joining Popovich on the coaching staff are\u00a0Golden State Warriors\u00a0coach Steve Kerr, Indiana Pacers assistant coach Lloyd Pierce and Villanova University coach Jay Wright. The Olympics opened on July 23 in Tokyo. The group stage of the Olympic basketball tournament took place from July 25 to Aug. 1, and the knockout stage will run from Aug. 3-7.

The U.S. team of Springsteen, Laura Kraut and McLain Ward took home silver in the jumping team final. After the event, Springsteen immediately called her parents to celebrate. The conversation, while joyous, wasn't exactly enlightening. \"I FaceTimed them really quick,\" said Springsteen, who's ranked 14th in the world. \"They were all screaming, I don't think we understood anything.\" The U.S. had a shot at gold in a jump-off with Sweden, the exact situation it faced en route to its 2018 world championship. This time, however, the Swedes came out on top with a time of 122.90 and no penalties as opposed to the Americans' 124.20 and no penalties. Springsteen isn't the only American equestrian with a fascinating background. Her teammate Laura Kraut, who won gold in the team jumping event in the 2008 Beijing Games, became the U.S.'s oldest Olympic medalist at age 55. Even though Springsteen's dad once performed for 300,000 people, she wasn't free of nerves during Saturday's final. She persevered through the nerves and earned her country a medal anyway. \"You definitely start to get the jitters,\" Springsteen said. \"But it was also super exciting.

  "body": "The 2020 Tokyo Olympics may be coming to a close on Sunday, but the competition looks to remain as exciting as ever in the interim. Finals in women's basketball, women's volleyball and the men's marathon are set for Saturday, the Games' penultimate day, with the U.S. vying for gold in all. Here's what to watch on Saturday, Day 16 of the Games, and a quick recap of all the Olympic action that transpired on Friday. Stay up to date with how countries are performing at the Games by checking out our medal counter. Team USA collected its fourth consecutive gold medal in a 87-82 victory over a France team led by Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier. Kevin Durant scored a team-leading 29 points for the U.S. while adding six rebounds and three assists. The 32-year-old forward now joins Carmelo Anthony -- who he just passed on Team USA's all-time scoring list -- as the only three-time men's basketball gold medalists in Olympic history. Fellow American Jayson Tatum contributed 19 points and seven rebounds. American Molly Seidel claimed bronze in the women's marathon, giving the U.S. its first women's marathon medal since Deena Kastor's bronze in 2004 and third all-time. Kenya's Peres Jepchirchir and Brigid Kosgei finished 1-2 and just above Seidel (2:27:46) with season-best times of 2:27:20 and 2:27:36, respectively. This was just the third ever marathon for Seidel, a four-time cross-country champion at Notre Dame, and she made the most of it. Nelly Korda, the world's top-ranked golfer, shot a 17-under 267 to win Team USA's first women's golf gold medal since 1900. She fended off strong competition from Japan's Mone Inami and Australia's Lydia Ko, who tied at 268, to win by a single stroke. Inami and Ko finished with silver and bronze, respectively, after they competed in a playoff for second. This is the Americans' second gold medal in golf in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, as Xander Schauffele won gold on the men's side last Sunday. The U.S. took home silver in the jumping team final, falling just shy of Sweden in a jump-off for gold. Belgium won bronze. American equestrian Laura Kraut, 55, became her country's oldest Olympic medalist since 1904. A two-time Olympian, Kraut also won gold in the team jumping event in the 2008 Beijing Games. McLain Ward and Jessica Springsteen, the daughter of singers Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa, won silver alongside Kraut in the event. This U.S.-Sweden matchup is a rematch of a prior classic, as the Americans bested the Swedes in a jump-off at the 2018 world championship. Team USA trotted out its biggest stars for the women's 4x400 relay final in Sydney McLaughlin, Allyson Felix, Dalilah Muhammad and Athing Mu. They were as dominant as advertised. The American foursome sped to a gold medal-winning time of 3:16.85, the event's fifth-fastest time ever. Poland finished second with a national-record time of 3:30.53 while Jamaica took bronze with a season-best 3:21.24. The silver gave the 35-year-old Felix -- who's competing in her fifth and final Games -- her 11th Olympic medal, the most by any U.S. track and field athlete in history. Her 10 coming into the race was tied with fellow American Carl Lewis. Men's track and field was largely a struggle for the U.S. in the 2021 Games, but its finish was anything but. Michael Cherry, Michael Norman, Bryce Deadmon and Rae Benjamin dominated the men's 4x400 relay, finishing with a season-best time of 2:55.70 -- well ahead of silver-medalist Netherlands (2:57.18) and bronze-medalist Botswana (2:57.18). This was the second of two U.S. men's track and field golds in Tokyo, the fewest it's ever had in a single Olympics. Ryan Crouser, the world-record shot-putter, was the other American gold-medal winner. Team USA won its first ever Olympic silver medal in a 2-0 loss to Japan in the men's baseball final. Japan, which won its first medal since 2004 and first ever gold, became the first host country to win an Olympic men's baseball final. American infielder Eddy Alvarez, who served as an opening ceremony flag bearer, became the third American in history to earn medals in both the summer and winter Olympics. In the 2014 Sochi Games, Alvarez won silver in the men's 5000m relay speed-skating event.",

Korda's gold medal victory comes nearly one week after the fifth-ranked men's golfer in the world, Xander Schauffele, captured the top prize in the the men's competition. Korda, who also claimed the Women's PGA Championship back in June, posted a 17-under 267 across four rounds to claim a one-shot victory over Japan's Mone Inami and Australia's Lydia Ko. Inami and Ko posted matching 16-under 268s to finish with silver and bronze, respectively, as the pair competed in a playoff for the silver medal. \"It's crazy,\" Korda said after the win.\"It sounds absurd that I'm a gold medal [winner]. and I'm an Olympian. I don't know it just hasn't sunk in yet.\" Ko is the only back-to-back Olympic women's golf medalist since the sport returned to the Games in 2016 after a 112-year absence. She earned silver in the 2016 Rio Games, which she entered as the world's top-ranked player, and knows exactly how impressive it is to succeed with those expectations like Korda has. \"It's not easy playing as the No. 1 in the Olympics. I did that in Rio,\" Ko said. \"And for her to fight through those kind of pressure and expectations and to end up winning the gold, I think it shows what kind of class player she is. I'm sure this is the start of many more majors and many more wins for Nelly.\" Korda held a significant lead heading into the final round, but her 69 in that frame trailed the 65s of both Inami and Ko. Still, it was enough to secure a golf sweep of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics for the Americans. Prior to these Games, the American men's and women's golf teams had gone 121 years each without a golf gold medal. They both broke that barrier in Tokyo.",

  "body": "Luka Doncic leads Slovenia in the bronze medal game against Patty Mills and Australia on Saturday morning. The teams battle at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, with the winner joining the United States and France on the medal stand. Slovenia fell to France in a narrow contest in the semifinals. Australia fell short against the heavily-favored American side. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 a.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Slovenia as the 2.5-point favorite in the latest Slovenia vs. Australia odds, while the over-under for total points expected is 181.5. Before finalizing any Australia vs. Slovenia picks or bronze medal basketball predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics nearing a conclusion, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Saturday's Slovenia vs. Australia bronze medal matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 basketball odds and betting trends for Australia vs. Slovenia: Slovenia has been an offensive juggernaut throughout the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, and that is its calling card. Doncic is an elite initiator, averaging 24.2 points, 10.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists per game, and the team leads the tournament in averaging 102.4 points per game. Slovenia is a tremendously efficient shooting team, making 49 percent of its shots overall, and it has the best 2-point shooting mark (61 percent) in the field. Slovenia's overall shot profile is analytically sound, with a tournament-leading 21.8 free-throw attempts per game and more 3-point attempts than any other squad. Finally, Slovenia's offense is well-rounded. Slovenia is grabbing 14.0 offensive rebounds per game, leading the Olympics, and is committing only 11.4 turnovers per contest. Australia is fully capable of scoring in bunches, but Slovenia's offensive track record is highly impressive and Doncic projects as the best player on the floor in the bronze medal matchup. Australia is a beautifully effective offensive team. The Australians are averaging more than 86 points per game in Tokyo, and a lot of that can be attributed to ball movement and perimeter shooting. Australia is No. 2 in the tournament in 3-point accuracy at more than 40 percent, and the Australians attempt more than 30 shots per game from long distance. Australia is also No. 2 in assists (24.8 per game), and it is generating nearly two assists for every turnover committed during the Olympics. Mills is the centerpiece of Australia's offensive approach, and the veteran guard is producing 19.6 points and 5.8 assists per game while connecting on 44 percent of his 3-point attempts. Joe Ingles, a standout of the Utah Jazz, adds supporting talent, and the Australians also boast other NBA talents in Matisse Thybulle, Dante Exum, Matthew Dellavedova and recently signed big man Jock Landale. Thybulle is a force defensively, averaging 3.0 steals per game in Tokyo, and Australia can create havoc for the high-powered Slovenia offense. Tierney has taken a close look at the Slovenia vs. Australia Olympic basketball matchup from all angles and is leaning under on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the Slovenia vs. Australia spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball picks and predictions at SportsLine. So which side of the Slovenia vs. Australia spread is a must-back? Visit SportsLine now to get Mike Tierney's predictions for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, all from the renowned sportswriter who's covered nine Olympics in person and cashed big in both 2016 and '18, and find out.",

  "body": "Brazil will try to defend its title on Saturday when it faces pre-tournament favorite Spain in the men's soccer gold medal match at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Brazil came in as the second choice among oddsmakers for Olympics 2020 gold but has been more impressive in the tournament. Spain has looked fatigued and is struggling to score but boasts a ton of talent. Both had to fight hard to get here, with Brazil beating Mexico in a shootout after a 0-0 draw and Spain netting its goal in the 115th minute to beat Japan 1-0 in Tuesday's Tokyo 2020 semifinals. Each has won a gold medal, with each winning on its home turf -- Brazil at Rio 2016 and Spain at Barcelona 1992. Kickoff from Yokohama Stadium is set for 7:30 a.m ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Brazil as the slight +160 favorite (risk $100 to win $160) on the 90-minute money line in its latest Brazil vs. Spain odds, while Spain is the +190 underdog. The over-under for total goals scored is set at 1.5. Before you lock in your Spain vs. Brazil picks or 2020 Tokyo Olympics predictions, you need to see what consummate soccer insider Martin Green has to say. After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Since then, his European soccer picks have been spot-on. Green has generated nearly $19,000 for $100 bettors since the 2017-18 season, and he has his finger on the pulse of the game all over the globe. Now, Green has taken a close look at the Brazil vs. Spain matchup and revealed his 2020 Tokyo Olympics soccer picks. You can head to SportsLine now to see the picks. Here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Spain vs. Brazil: The Brazilians have lost two friendlies but have not lost in a competitive match in their last 12 (8-4-0) and are on a seven-game unbeaten run overall. They bunkered down against a tough Mexico squad but still had 67 percent possession and six shots on net before proving their class in the shootout. This under-23 team plays with the skill common of the Selecao senior team, with Everton's Richarlison and Hertha Berlin's Matheus Cunja forming a dangerous partnership up top. Richarlison is the tournament's top scorer with five goals, while Cunha has scored two. Brazil has won four medals in five appearances at the Summer Games, also winning two bronze and a silver, since the age restrictions were put in place in 1992. Spain has qualified just one other time since 2000, failing to advance in London in 2012. Brazil manager Andre Jardine chose to provide a safety net on defense for his young squad with his over-age selections. Captain Dani Alves, 38, and Sevilla's Diego Carlos, 28, anchor the unit, while 31-year-old goalkeeper Santos also provides leadership and has allowed just three goals in the five matches. The Spaniards have struggled to score goals, but the talent is certainly there. With Spanish law requiring club teams to release players for Olympic duty, the team had its pick of young players and three veterans. The squad includes six who played key roles in the team's Euro 2020 semifinal run last month. They have shown signs of fatigue, but they should find a second gear with gold on the line. The team also has plenty of depth if it ends up in extra time. Real Madrid's Marco Asensio, 25, is one of three over-age players and netted the winner against Japan. Asensio plays opposite Dani Olmo and Mikel Oyarzabal in a potent attack. Olmo also has a goal, while Oyarzabal has two, and Rafa Mir had a hat trick as a substitute to save the quarterfinal against Ivory Coast. Oyarzabal also can set up goals and has 19 assists over the past two seasons with Real Sociedad. Spain is solid in the back and has allowed just three goals in the five games. Barcelona's Eric Garcia and Villareal's Pau Torres are two of the world's best young defenders and are backed by Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Unai Simon. Green has taken a close look at the Brazil vs. Spain match from all sides, and he's leaning under on the goal total. He has two confident best bets and a full breakdown of this 2020 Tokyo Olympics gold-medal match. He's only sharing those expert soccer picks at SportsLine. So who wins Brazil vs. Spain?

  "body": "Two teams will try to end their gold medal droughts in baseball when Team USA Baseball and Japan collide in the gold medal game of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on Saturday at Yokohama Baseball Stadium. The United States has not won gold in baseball since 2000 in Sydney. Meanwhile Japan has never won gold and has reached the gold medal game only once, in 1996. Baseball has been an Olympic sport since 1992 and was not contested in 2012 or '16. First pitch is set for 6 a.m. ET. Japan is the -200 favorite (risk $200 to win $100) in the latest USA vs. Japan odds from Caesars Sportsbook while the United States is the +170 underdog. The over-under for total runs scored is 8.5. Before making any Japan vs. United States picks, make sure you check out the Olympics 2020 predictions and betting advice from CBS Sports baseball guru Matt Snyder. A former player for Indiana University and a member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, Snyder has been a baseball writer with CBS Sports since 2011. CBS Sports' longest-tenured baseball expert combines simple logic learned from his baseball-playing days with an extensive background in analytics. He went 26-18 on his MLB picks in the 2020 MLB playoffs, including 8-4 on World Series bets. Now, Snyder has set his sights on the United States vs. Japan gold medal game and revealed his Olympic baseball picks and predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see his picks. Here are the Olympics baseball odds and betting trends for Japan vs. USA: The Japanese have their pitching lined up much better than the Americans. Japan has played one fewer game than the Americans and its pitchers have been rested since Wednesday -- all of its arms should be available. On Saturday the Japanese will start Masato Morishita, who allowed just two runs on five hits over five innings against Mexico on July 31. In addition, Hayato Sakamoto brings a hot bat into Saturday's game. The 32-year-old shortstop is batting .389 and leads the team in slugging (.722) and doubles (three). In Japan's 7-6 victory over the Americans on Monday he went 3-for-5 with one run and one RBI. The Americans have a favorable matchup against Morishita. The weakness in Team USA's lineup is striking out (50 strikeouts in 166 at-bats), but Morishita is not a swing-and-miss pitcher. He has just 77 strikeouts in 95.1 innings in his NPB season and struck out just three against Mexico in his only other start at the Olympics. In addition, Triston Casas has been on fire for the United States. A first baseman in the Red Sox organization, Casas leads all Olympians in home runs (three) and RBI (eight) and ranks third in slugging (.789). On Monday against Japan, Casas went 2-for-4 with two runs and three RBI. Snyder has broken down this matchup, and one of his picks is over for the run total. But he has discovered a critical X-factor that has him jumping all over one side of the run line. Head to SportsLine now to see his analysis and expert Olympic baseball picks. So who wins Japan vs. United States in the gold medal game? And where does all the betting value lie?

  "body": "While the gold medal won't be distributed until Saturday evening, there is more women's basketball action to monitor in the 2020 Summer Olympics. France takes on Serbia on Saturday morning in Tokyo, with a medal on the line. The teams faltered in the semifinals, but the bronze medal is up for grabs, leaving plenty to play for. Both teams have displayed versatility and resilience in the Olympics, with a competitive game likely in the offing. Tip-off is scheduled for 3 a.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists France as a two-point favorite in the latest France vs. Serbia odds. The over-under for total points is set at 142.5. Before finalizing any Serbia vs. France women's basketball picks or predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics rolling on, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Saturday's France vs. Serbia matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Serbia vs. France: France is one of the more efficient shooting teams in the Olympics to this point. The French are burying more than 78 percent of their free-throw attempts and, inside the arc, the French are converting 54.4 percent of their shots. They also have the edge in the passing department, with France averaging more assists (21.6 per game) and fewer turnovers (13.4 per game) than Serbia so far in Tokyo. Defensively, France has caused complete havoc for the opposition at times, including 9.2 steals per game in the tournament. Gabby Williams is the leader in that defensive attack, averaging 3.2 steals per game on her own, and the former top-five WNBA draft pick adds 9.4 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.6 assists per contest. Offensively, Sandrine Gruda is the team's centerpiece, leading the squad with 13.4 points per game on 63 percent shooting, and an impressive 6.2 rebounds per game. France is the more talented team on paper, and it\u00a0can lean on that advantage. As the reigning Eurobasket champions, the Serbian side is not afraid of the moment. The Serbians are incredibly balanced offensively, and there is also star power in play. Sonja Vasic the face of the squad, and she won the Eurobasket MVP to go along with the team's triumph. Vasic is averaging 9.8 points and a team-leading 6.4 rebounds per game in Tokyo, and she is connecting on 45.5 percent of her 3-point attempts. Yvonne Anderson is the team's leading scorer, averaging 12.0 points per game, but five players are averaging at least 6.4 points per contest. All told, a large part of Serbia's effectiveness has come defensively, and it will need to continue that. This is a team known for its grinding approach, and it can clamp down on France, or any opponent, for long stretches of time. Tierney has taken a close look at the Serbia vs. France Olympic basketball matchup from all angles and is leaning under on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the spread. He's only sharing his top picks and Olympics 2020 basketball predictions at SportsLine.

  "body": "Team USA Basketball, led by a host of NBA stars, aims to win the gold medal on Friday evening. The United States faces France in the men's championship contest at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, with sky-high anticipation. Team USA is the significant favorite as the Americans aim for a fourth-straight gold medal. France is the challenger, though it is led by several talented NBA players, headlined by Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier. Tip-off is scheduled for 10:30 p.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists Team USA Basketball as a 12.5-point favorite in the latest USA vs. France odds. The over-under for total points is set at 175.5. Before finalizing any France vs. USA picks or gold medal basketball predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time.

Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics winding down, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Friday's Team USA vs. France gold medal matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the 2020 Olympic basketball odds and betting trends for France vs. USA: In expected fashion, the United States team has been virtually unguardable throughout the tournament. Team USA is averaging 101.4 points per game while leading the entire field in assists (25.6 per game), assist-to-turnover ratio (2.5), field-goal percentage (50.7 percent) and 3-point percentage (41.0 percent). The Americans are also shooting a blistering 59 percent on 2-point attempts, and they have tough shotmakers all over the roster when the opposing defense responds. Team USA is also facing a French team that has committed the most fouls in the tournament, and the United States is shooting 81 percent at the charity stripe in Tokyo. Individually, Kevin Durant leads the way with 19.0 points per game on elite-level shooting efficiency, and Jayson Tatum adds 14.4 points per game on 42 percent shooting from 3-point range. Jrue Holiday, Bam Adebayo and Draymond Green anchor an elite defense when engaged, and the Americans flashed their incredible upside in turning a deficit into a comfortable lead against Australia. While it cannot match the United States player-for-player, France is a talented and cohesive team. The French have been highly efficient from a shooting standpoint in Tokyo, making 48 percent from the floor, 39 percent from 3-point range and 79 percent from the free-throw line. France is also an excellent rebounding team, including 11.4 offensive rebounds per contest during its Olympic run, and the team is anchored by Gobert. The Utah Jazz center is arguably the best defensive player in the basketball world, and he is also putting up 11.4 points and 9.6 rebounds per game during the tournament. Offensively, France also has intriguing talent, with Evan Fournier averaging 19.2 points per game on efficient shooting and former NBA guard Nando De Colo putting up 13.8 points and 6.0 assists per contest. Finally, do-it-all forward Nic Batum brings versatility and experience to the table, and he'll likely be tasked with defensive assignments against the top American perimeter players. Tierney has taken a close look at the USA vs. France gold medal matchup from all angles and is leaning under on the point total. He's also found a critical x-factor that has him jumping on one side of the Team USA vs. France spread.

  "body": "The Dominican Republic will try to earn its first Olympic medal in baseball when it takes on South Korea in the bronze medal game of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on Saturday at Yokohama Baseball Stadium. The Dominicans are playing in the Olympics for just the second time. In their only other appearance, in 1992, they finished sixth. Meanwhile South Korea won the gold medal the last time that baseball was an Olympic sport, in 2008 in Beijing. First pitch is set for 11 p.m. ET on Friday. South Korea is the -160 favorite (risk $160 to win $100) in the latest South Korea vs. Dominican Republic odds from Caesars Sportsbook while the Dominican Republic is the +140 underdog. The over-under for total runs scored is 8.5. Before finalizing any South Korea vs. Dominican Republic picks, be sure to check out the Olympics predictions and betting advice from CBS Sports baseball guru Matt Snyder. A former player for Indiana University and a member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, Snyder has been a baseball writer with CBS Sports since 2011. CBS Sports' longest-tenured baseball expert combines simple logic learned from his baseball-playing days with an extensive background in analytics. He went 26-18 on MLB picks in the 2020 MLB playoffs, including 8-4 on World Series bets. Now, Snyder has set his sights on Dominican Republic vs. South Korea. You can head to SportsLine to see his picks. Here are the 2020 Olympics baseball odds and betting trends for South Korea vs. Dominican Republic: The defending gold medalists will be getting their second look at Dominican Republic starter Raul Valdes. On Sunday the South Koreans put a lot of traffic on the bases with seven hits and three walks in 5.1 innings against Valdes but managed just one run. Seeing Valdes for the second time in seven days should work to South Korea's advantage. In addition the South Koreans have been getting contributions up and down the lineup. Hyunsoo Kim, who played with the Orioles and Twins in the majors, has been the team's best hitter (.385 average, .731 slugging percentage, two home runs and six RBI). But Hae Min Park is batting .400 (fifth best in the tournament) and has scored a tournament-best six runs, while Ji Hwan Oh is slugging .684 with two home runs and five RBI. The Dominicans have been the best fielding team in the tournament. They have committed just one error over five games and have a fielding percentage of .994. The combination of defense and strong pitching has helped them limit opponents to just 17 runs in Tokyo. In addition the Dominicans have been the stronger pitching team so far in the tournament. They rank second in the field in ERA, at 3.56. By comparison the South Koreans have a 4.50 ERA over six games. Snyder has broken down this matchup, and one of his picks is under for the run total (8.5). But he has discovered a critical X-factor that has him jumping all over one side of the money line. Head to SportsLine to see his analysis and top Olympic baseball picks. So who wins South Korea vs. Dominican Republic? And where does all the betting value lie?

  "body": "The Olympics provide inspirational stories and/or tales of sacrifice so frequently, it can often feel like they are a prerequisite for qualification. As a result, it's natural to sometimes become a bit numb to the trope. Nevertheless, every Olympics gives way to a handful of stories that break through to the mainstream and once more help shape our appreciation for how much these elite human beings endure, what they train for to have a chance at glory in their sport and on a global stage once every four (or, in this case, five) years. The Olympics' final weekend in Tokyo brought one of those moments. At these Games, there might not be an athlete embodying a story with a greater combination of sacrifice, courage and long-lasting impact for others than the ever-revered Allyson Felix. The 35-year-old queen of American track is one for the ages. On Friday, Felix ran the women's 400-meter final in 49.46 seconds to capture her first Olympic bronze medal and add to a legendary career. Then, Saturday night at Olympic Stadium, Felix ran the second leg of a loaded women's 4x400 relay team. Everyone on the team had a gold to their name entering the race, including 2021 breakout stars Sydney McLaughlin and Athing Mu, who won their golds earlier in the week. The fourth member, Dalilah Muhammad, won gold in the 400-meter hurdles in 2016 and took silver behind McLaughlin on Wednesday. The U.S. quartet blew the field away. With Mu anchoring the relay, Team USA crossed first in 3:16.85. That gold-winning performance put Felix on an echelon all to her own in Olympic history. With this being her final Olympics, Felix will finish with 11 medals -- the most of any track and field athlete in history. Seven golds, three silvers and a bronze. Her longevity is phenomenal. Track sports are normally not for the aged, yet here is Felix -- who just became the oldest U.S. woman to ever win a gold track medal -- with at least one podium appearance in five consecutive Olympics. That's only been done by two other athletes: Jamaican track stars Merlene Ottey and Veronica Campbell-Brown. For four consecutive Olympics, from 2008-2021, Felix won a gold medal. Unprecedented in American track history. On Friday, in the 400, Felix got it done by running like the exceptional, resilient veteran she is, doing so from all the way out in Lane 9. That's not the spot most sprinters win medals from. But as we've seen for well over a decade: Felix isn't most sprinters. The greatest runner in women's track history held her elongated turn with confident pace and never relented on her speed in the final 50 meters. Not only was it fast enough for a bronze, it was Felix rising to a necessary Olympic level once more in order to find the podium. That 49.46 sprint was Felix's fastest 400 time in six years -- meaning she ran better in Tokyo as a 35-year-old mom than when she took the silver in this event in 2016 at the age of 30. It was, in fact, the second-fastest 400 Felix ran in her life. From Lane 9. Remarkable. Bahamian Shaunae Miller-Uibo won gold (48.36), while Marileidy Paulino, of the Dominican Republic, took silver (49.20). Felix's 11 medals don't just distinguish her in terms of track athletes; she's forever in a special pantheon of all-time greats throughout sports. Friday's bronze tied her with none other than Carl Lewis for the most track and field medals by an American in history, and then Saturday marked the fourth consecutive Olympics that Felix won gold as a member of the women's 4x400 squad. Team USA has won gold in seven straight Olympics in that event. Yet, as recently as a few years ago, almost nobody thought she'd be here. Between her last appearance on an Olympic stage in Rio de Janeiro and now, Felix affected change throughout the world of track and field. She stood up to a multi-billion-dollar corporation. She testified to Congress about inequalities and child mortality rates in the Black community, doing so after overcoming her own serious pregnancy health scare. After the 2016 Games, when Felix won two golds and a silver, she knew it was time: she wanted to start her family. The decision to have a child has affected the careers of countless female track athletes over the decades. For most, it signaled an end to their Olympic aspirations. Felix didn't believe that should have to be her reality -- nor anyone else's going forward, if they didn't want it to be -- and she didn't want the $30 billion corporation sponsoring her, Nike, to think that was the case either. But that's not what happened. In 2018, as Felix was training in secret and avoiding initially revealing her pregnancy to Nike, she was also in negotiations for a new contract. She didn't believe it to be right for Nike to have the power to significantly reduce how much she would be paid in the future based off her performance while pregnant and during her postpartum period. Nike balked. It didn't agree. With motherhood now in Felix's near future, Nike was clear: the company would not be open to continuing to sponsor and pay Felix the same way going forward. Here was an all-time Olympian just two years removed from amassing more Olympic golds than any female track athlete in history, and she was being bullied out of a deal. Nike was prepared to cut the terms of Felix's endorsement by as much as 70%. In light of what Felix has done since, this now amounts to one of the more embarrassing marketing miscalculations of the past decade in all of sports. It was also narrow-minded and discriminatory. The decision obviously angered Felix, who became inspired to speak out, and in doing so, violated the terms of her non-disclosure agreement with the company. It would mean the end of her endorsement deal with the most powerful apparel brand company on the planet.\u00a0She first spoke out in a New York Times op-ed, in a moment of true courage that was in some ways precedent-setting. After all, how often do we see an athlete speak out against a company that endorses them? For Felix, the battle was always bigger than money. It was about making people understand that just because it's women who carry the burden of bearing children, it shouldn't mean women should also have to accept endorsement and earning restrictions based off their performance as mothers or mothers-to-be. Felix left Nike, signed with Athleta, and within months the uproar was so loud that Nike wound up changing its policy regarding female athletes and contractual agreements tied to childbirth. By then it was too late for Nike to keep Felix. Amid all of this, she was forced to have an emergency cesarean section seven months into her pregnancy because of a potentially life-threatening condition brought on by high blood pressure. Her baby daughter, Camryn, had to live for more than a month in the NICU. In late June, after Felix rallied to qualify for the Olympics for a fifth time -- with 2-year-old Camryn on hand to watch -- she posted the photo below to Instagram. Draped in a god's haul of medals, there was also the deliberate artistic decision to include her C-section scar, as it's now a significant part of her story and a mark on her body that represents so much of what she went through over the past three years to get to this point. \"I used my voice and built this company for you. So that you never have to train at 4:30am while you're 5 months pregnant to hide your pregnancy from your sponsor,\" Felix wrote. \"The world doesn't need more shoes, but the world does need to see women wholly and meet them right where they are.\" When Felix crossed the finish line Friday, and when she stepped to the podium to receive her gold on Saturday, she did so wearing her own new shoe, the Saysh One. It was designed by her own company and with a team of women who created the product. What happened this weekend at Olympic Stadium was so much more than a couple of age-defying sprints by the greatest female track star of all time. Friday's 400 took 49.46 seconds to finish, but in reality this is a race that started years ago. Thanks to Allyson Felix, we can actually start to see the finish line.",

  "body": "The Canadian women's national soccer team became Olympic gold medalists after winning a dramatic penalty-kick shootout in the final against Sweden. The two teams played to a 1-1 draw in regulation and were unable to break through during two periods of extra time. Stina Blackstenius scored in regulation for Sweden, and Jessie Fleming converted a penalty kick for the equalizer. The two sides both had a strong showing in the first half, as each team spent time in each other's half, though Sweden did far more with their opportunities in the final third. Blackstenius broke the deadlock in the 34th minute, as the Europeans led Canada in total shots (11-3), despite splitting possession at 50%. Canada's opportunity to equalize came way via penalty as Swedish defender Amanda Lestedt made contact on Christine Sinclair inside the box and VAR confirmed the foul. Fleming converted the penalty in the 67th minute, as Canada remained active in front of goal during stoppage time of regulation. Fatigue settled in each during the two halves of extra time, and substitutions nearly made the difference as Deanne Rose and Jordyn Huitema had chances for Canada and Lina Hurtig nearly connected on set pieces for Sweden, but the game headed to penalties to determine the gold medal. Sweden entered the gold medal match unbeaten in their Tokyo campaign and winners of five consecutive matches ahead of the Olympic final. In the build-up to the final, the team did not need penalty kicks to decide any of their knockout stage games. Canada's journey to the gold medal match presented narrow draws, extra-time scenarios, and penalty kicks. As the two Olympic finalists traded makes and misses (both teams missed three consecutive spot kicks at one point), and each keeper made saves. Candian keeper Stephanie Labb\u00e9 made a huge save on Sweden's Andersson, and Julia Grosso converted her attempt to give Canada the Olympic gold for the first time in their history. Sinclair, the all-time leading goal scorer in international soccer, made her exit in the gold medal match during regulation in the 87th minute to make way for Huitema and was unavailable for penalty kick selection. The longtime captain missed a penalty kick earlier in the knockout stage, and when penalty opportunities were presented to Canada in the semifinal and gold medal final, her leadership came into play, collecting the ball and passing it off to Fleming to convert. The 23-year-old midfielder executed each time on her penalties during the Olympics. For the 38-year-old Sinclair, this was possibly her final game for Canada in a major tournament, capping off a historic international career with an Olympic gold medal to go along with her two bronze medals from the 2012 and 2016 Summer Games.",

  "body": "Team USA and France are the last two teams standing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and as such they will go head-to-head for the gold medal. The contest between the U.S. and France will serve as a rematch, as the two teams also met in the first game of group play last month. In that game, France pulled out a 83-76 win, thanks largely to Evan Fournier, who had a game-high 28 points on 11 of 22 shooting from the floor. Rudy Gobert also added 14 points and nine rebounds of his own. As a team, France shot an impressive 47 percent from the floor. It outscored the U.S. 46-31 in the second half, and went on a16-2 run to close out the game and secure the win. The group stage loss was actually the United States' second straight to France in international play, as the French also prevailed over the U.S. in the 2019 FIBA World Cup. Given the way their last couple of meetings played out, it's safe to say that the Americans will be seeking revenge -- in addition to a gold medal. Falling to France was the only defeat that the U.S. suffered during these Olympics, while the French team has yet to lose a game. Here's everything you need to know about the gold medal game between the United States and France. Date:\u00a0Friday, Aug. 6\u00a0|\u00a0Time:\u00a010:30 p.m. ETLocation:\u00a0Saitama Super Arena -- Saitama, Japan\u00a0TV:\u00a0NBC and Peacock\u00a0|\u00a0Live stream:\u00a0fuboTV (Try for free)Odds:\u00a0USA -900; FRA +600\u00a0|\u00a0O/U:\u00a0175.5 (via William Hill Sportsbook) United States: Team USA has been playing much better basketball since they lost to France at the start of group play, but it will take a full 40-minute effort if the Americans are going to exact their revenge and claim a fourth consecutive gold medal. One obvious adjustment that the U.S. will have to make? They need to do a much better job of defending Fournier, who was the best player on the floor the first two the two teams met. Fournier hit big bucket after big bucket for France, and ultimately his production was a major determining factor in the contest. In all, he finished with a game-high 28 points while shooting 50 percent from the floor (11 of 22). He also knocked down four 3s and grabbed four rebounds. After the game, Fournier\u00a0provided an honest assessment\u00a0of Team USA. \"They are better individually but they can be beaten as a team,\" he said. It will now be up to Team USA to prove Fournier wrong, and limiting his offensive production will help their cause. They'll also have to shoot better than they did in the first game. The U.S. shot just 36 percent from the floor in that contest, compared to 47 percent from France. In a game that was decided by seven points, this made a big difference. France: It's tough to overstate how big of an opportunity the French team has here. France has won a silver medal in Olympic play twice (1948, 2000), but it has never won gold. Now, the only thing standing between the French and their first gold is a team that they've already bested in these very Olympics. Both times the French team has finished with the Silver Medal they lost to the U.S. in the championship game, so in a way they're seeking some revenge of their own. To get it, they'll need big games from Fournier, Gobert, Nic Batum and all of their other key contributors. The U.S. has been playing better basketball as the Olympics have gone on, and as such they're not the same team that dropped their Olympic opener to France late last month. They've found an identity on the defensive end, and their shot making has been there when it's mattered most. The French team is excellent, but at the end of the day the U.S. is the more talented team, and they should be able to take care of business. Pick: United States -12.5",

The reigning NFL MVP's praise of Biles extended beyond her work on the mat. In an interview with The Ringer, Rodgers credited Biles' ability to speak freely about her mental health and advocate the same for others. \"I give Simone so much credit for her ability to speak the truth, her truth, and to answer tough questions, and to have the courage to say, 'I'm scared' and 'I don't feel like I should be out there,'\" Rodgers said. \"She's the greatest gymnast of all time. And mental health [awareness] is an issue that is continuing to break down the stigmas that don't allow us to talk about it or only allow us to talk about it in a super negative, depressive, suicidal way. \"People of all ages and all professions are dealing with mental issues, especially during COVID... it's something we should be talking about and ways to help people get through it, whether it's techniques or therapy or just conversations letting people know they're not alone. And that's what Simone did. I'm very, very proud of her.\" Biles, who withdrew from four finals for mental health reasons, was seen supporting teammates Suni Lee, MyKala Skinner and Jade Carey throughout their respective runs that ended in winning Olympic hardware. That American group won silver in the team competition, without Biles, preceding the individual events. Athletes, Rodgers claims, have higher platforms to deliver important messages such as mental health advocacy. Biles has spoken extensively on that very subject these Games, doing everything from explaining what the \"twisties\" are to outlining her personal struggles with the yips-like issue. Talking like Biles has is a trend Rodgers, who has \"gotten to know her a little bit at times over the years,\" hopes continues. \"Well, we should keep talking about it,\" Rodgers said. \"Keep talking about ways that we individually deal with stress and deal with anxiety and deal with pressure and deal with depression or loneliness. I think that would really help. Because we, whether we like it or not, have a platform to influence people. \"And our words are often listened to more than the person who's not in the public eye as much. So we have an opportunity -- not an obligation, an opportunity -- to maybe share some of our own ways of dealing with things and break some of the stigma around mental health.\"",

After what he pulled off in the match with Petriashvili, Steveson's efforts have him bordering on being an Olympic wrestling legend. Steveson was down 8-5 with less than 30 seconds remaining but pulled off two takedowns to win the match, 10-8. The second takedown will go down as an all-time great moment in the history of amateur wrestling. Still down 8-7 with 6.5 seconds remaining, Steveson pressured before turning the corner and securing the winning takedown inside the final second of the match. Here's a look at how it played out: The win completed an amazing 2020 Games for Steveson. The 21-year-old had not allowed an opponent to score a single point against him in the three rounds prior to the gold medal match. That included an 8-0 win over 2016 Olympic gold medalist Taha Akgul of Turkey. Steveson has not lost an international match in two years and is now the first American heavyweight to win Olympic gold since Bruce Baumgartner in 1992. \"I took him down and I saw there was about 10 seconds left,\" Steveson said after his win. \"I got off him, ref blew the whistle and at that point it was do or die, and I just had to go. I can't even describe it, I'm somewhere else right now. \"I knew I had it in me. I knew I had it in me. Everybody talks about bringing home a gold medal, and I did it.\"",

Here's everything you missed from Thursday, Day 14 of the Olympic Games -- including the continuation of Team USA women's basketball's historic run -- and what to follow on Day 15. Stay up to date with how countries are performing at the Games by checking out our medal counter. The U.S. claimed its fourth gold in the last five Olympics with a win over Australia late Thursday. April Ross and Alix Klineman -- the Southern California natives nicknamed the \"A-Team\" because their first names both start with the letter A -- won their seventh consecutive match, with this one coming in straight sets, 21-15, 21-16. This was Ross' second Olympic medal and first gold, while it's Klineman's first. Former \"A-Team\" member Mr. T approves. Team USA throttled Serbia, 79-59, in Thursday's semifinal and is now one win away from its seventh consecutive gold medal. Brittney Griner led the squad with 15 points and 12 rebounds, while Breanna Stewart added a double-double of her own with 12 points and 10 boards.  The Americans are on the verge of history, as only one Olympic team before them -- in any sport -- has won seven gold medals in a row (U.S. men's basketball, 1936-68). The win over Serbia was Team USA's 54th straight. The Americans will battle the winner of France-Japan in the gold medal game on Saturday at 10:30 p.m. ET. The American's found success on the indoor volleyball court in addition to the sand, as it defeated Serbia in straight sets to reach the gold medal game.

They beat Serbia 79-59 in the semifinals to advance to the gold medal game at the Tokyo Olympics and run their historic Olympics winning streak to 54 games. After an even first couple of minutes, Team USA went on a 7-0 run to take a lead they would never relinquish. They led 26-12 after the first quarter, and save for a brief portion of the second, they maintained that double-digit advantage for the rest of the way. Much like the quarterfinal against Australia, the game was out of hand for the entire second half. It wasn't the prettiest offensive display Team USA has ever had, but it was more than good enough with the way they were playing defense. This was a truly elite defensive performance from the Americans, as they flew around in passing lanes, protected the paint and largely disrupted everything Serbia was trying to do. They held Serbia to just 59 points on 30 shooting from the field, and forced 12 turnovers. If it wasn't for a strong effort on the offensive glass, in which they earned 10 second-chance points, the outcome would have been even worse for Serbia. As per usual, Team USA worked inside-out and were led by the frontcourt. Brittney Griner continued her strong play in Tokyo with 15 points and 12 rebounds for her second double-double of the tournament. Breanna Stewart added a double-double of her own with 12 points and 10 rebounds, while Chelsea Gray came off the bench to put up 14 points in her best performance so far. Now, Team USA will play for a historic seventh straight gold medal on Saturday against the winner of the second semifinal between France and Japan. Team USA has already beaten both of those teams in the group stage, and that was when they were still trying to figure some things out. With the way they've played since the knockout stage began, Team USA will be massive favorites to win it all no matter who they have to play.",

  "body": "Mexico won't get another gold medal, but it wants something to show for its efforts at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics when it faces host Japan in Friday's men's soccer bronze-medal match. Japan had hoped its brick-wall defense would put it in line for gold, but both teams came up just short. Mexico, the gold medalist at the 2012 London Games, lost in a shootout to Brazil after playing to 0-0 stalemate, while Japan also held Spain scoreless for 115 minutes before a stinging 1-0 loss. The teams met in the Tokyo 2020 group stage, and Japan went on to win the group on the strength of a 2-1 victory. Japan lost to South Korea in the bronze-medal match at those 2012 Olympics. Kickoff is set for 7:30 a.m ET at Saitama Stadium. Mexico is the slight +150 favorite (risk $100 to win $150) on the 90-minute money line in the latest Mexico vs. Japan odds from Caesars Sportsbook. Japan is the +170 underdog, while the over-under for total goals scored is 2.5. Before finalizing any Mexico vs. Japan picks or 2020 Tokyo Olympics predictions, you have to see what consummate soccer insider Martin Green has to say. After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Since then, his European soccer picks have been spot-on. Green has generated nearly $19,000 for $100 bettors since the 2017-18 season, and he has his finger on the pulse of the game all over the globe. Now, Green has taken a close look at the Japan vs. Mexico matchup and revealed his Olympics soccer best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see the picks. Here are the Olympic soccer odds and betting trends for Mexico vs. Japan: El Tri played a strong match in the group-stage meeting but couldn't catch up after going down by two goals early. A converted penalty in the 12th minute put Japan up 2-0 in the 12th minute, and a second-half Johan Vazquez red card left Mexico playing with 10 men for more than 20 minutes. El Tri dominated possession, but could not find the goals. It also buckled down to hold a powerful Brazil team without a goal for 120 minutes before falling on penalties. Now it faces a Japan team that could be discouraged not to have a chance at gold in its home event. Both teams have been known for their defense, but the Mexicans have more attacking talent. Midfielder Luis Romo is the engine of the offense, while fellow Mexican Liga MX star Henry Martin is the finisher. Romo had a goal and two assists in a 6-3 win against South Korea in the quarterfinals, while Martin is tied for the team lead with Francisco Cordova after scoring three goals in the five matches. Goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa, Martin's teammate with Liga MX contender Club America, is one of the team's leaders and is a steady presence in the net. The Japanese squad has been organized and efficient, allowing just two goals in the five games. It held Mexico off the score sheet for the first 85 minutes in the July 25 win and did not concede to Spain until late in extra time. The loss to the Spaniards snapped a nine-game unbeaten run that saw Japan yield just three goals while scoring 24. This team is built for defense, with backs Maya Yoshida and Hiroki Sakai joining fierce defensive midfielder Wataru Endo as the three over-age players on the roster. Japan is 7-3-4 in its last three Olympics appearances. Japan also is seeking revenge against Mexico after El Tri ousted it from London 2012 on its way to the gold medal. It will have the entire nation behind it and knows from last month's victory that it can take the bronze medal if it executes the same way. Japan took a 2-0 lead in the first 12 minutes then sat back to defend. Mexico controlled the ball for 62 percent of the match but had just four shots on target. Takefusa Kubo, a 20-year-old prospect who is trying to earn playing time with Real Madrid, scored the first goal. That was the second of his three in the tournament. Green has examined the Japan vs. Mexico match from every angle and has revealed a pair of best bets.\u00a0He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine.

  "body": "A spot in the gold-medal game is on the line when France takes on Japan in women's basketball on Friday in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Both teams are trying to unseat the heavily favored United States squad, but they must first defeat the other. France defeated Spain in the quarterfinals. Japan knocked off Belgium to advance to this point. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 a.m. ET. Caesars Sportsbook lists France as a three-point favorite in the Japan vs. France odds. The over-under, or total number of points expected, is 149. Before finalizing any France vs. Japan basketball picks or predictions, you need to see what SportsLine's Olympics expert, Mike Tierney, has to say. A national sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, Tierney has covered nine Olympic Games in person. At Rio in 2016, Tierney profited big-time. He told readers to bet over on Team USA's gold medal count (41.5) and over on Team USA's overall medal count (102.5). The result? 46 golds, 121 medals and two easy cashes. And for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Tierney hit two of his three predictions: Germany (+200) to win the most gold medals and the United States winning under 10.5 gold medals (+110). Now, with the Tokyo Summer Olympics rolling on, Tierney has analyzed every angle of Friday's France vs. Japan matchup and revealed his top Olympic basketball picks and predictions. He's only sharing those picks at SportsLine. Now, here are the Olympics 2020 odds and betting trends for Japan vs. France: Japan's only loss in the tournament came against the United States and the Japanese are playing with confidence. They knocked off Belgium by a one-point margin and, in the process, reached the Olympic semifinals for the first time. Moreover, Japan isn't shy about its ambition. \"Four and a half years ago, I said my goal, my dream, is to beat America in the Tokyo Olympics in the championship game,\" Japan head coach Thomas Wayne Hovasse told the media after the quarterfinal win. \"Everybody laughed at me. I don't know, there might be some people starting to believe now.\" France has been up-and-down at times during the Olympics, but managed to escape with a narrow defeat over Spain in the quarterfinals. The French played very well down the stretch and, overall, France has played with improved tempo in Tokyo when compared to previous tournaments. Defensively, France is generating havoc on a consistent basis, and that is manifested with 8.8 steals per game, a top-three mark in the tournament. On the offensive end, France is balanced in nature, with four players averaging in double figures. Sandrine Gruda leads the way to this point, averaging 12.5 points per game and shooting 60 percent from the floor. Gruda is also an excellent rebounder, picking up 7.0 caroms per game. Elsewhere, Gabby Williams has been excellent, putting up 10.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and a whopping 3.3 steals per game. Tierney has taken a close look at the Japan vs. France Olympic basketball matchup from all angles and is leaning over on the point total.

Americans April Ross and Alix Klineman beat Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho del Solar of Australia in straight sets on Thursday night to win gold in the event. For the U.S., it is their first gold in women's beach volleyball since the legendary tandem of Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings were the last team standing at the 2012 Games in London. For May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings, that 2012 win was their straight gold medal in the event. This may be the start of a similar stretch for Ross and Klineman. The Americans did not lose a single set in their elimination matches en route to the final, and against the pair of Australians, it was much of the same story. After taking the first set, 21-15, Ross and Klineman went down 2-0 to begin the second frame. Then, they turned it on and went on a 10-1 scoring run to create some distance. The Australians fought back and came to within 20-16 in the second set. But that would be as close as they came, as the Americans scored on match point to win the final. \"It's so tough,\" Ross said. \"It was such a shot in the dark. For us to get here and do this, with this kind of competition just blows my mind. To get a gold medal finally, feels so amazing\" For Ross, 39, it was her third Olympic medal and her first gold. She won silver with Jen Kessy at the 2012 Games and took home a bronze at the 2016 Olympics alongside her partner, the aforementioned Walsh Jennings. The win in Tokyo also makes Ross the oldest women to win a gold at the Olympics in any type of volleyball event. As for Klineman, the Tokyo Games were the first Olympics she has ever competed in. \"I still don't know if i really ever expected this to come true,\" Klineman said. \"It feels like such a fairy tale.\"",

One of those people is Houston Texans safety Jonathan Owens, Biles' boyfriend, who opened up about his feelings on the situation to reporters at Texans training camp on Thursday. According to a report by the Houston Chronicle, Owens shared that he had been able to communicate with Biles while she was competing in Tokyo, and did his best to try and keep her positive and motivated while she dealt with the \"twisties\" in addition to other mental stresses that forced her to withdraw from several gymnastics competitions. Owens also stated that he had a sense of what was going on when Biles withdrew from team competition. \"I remember it was early in the morning, and my heart was really  beating because I could see her face, and I kind of know her facial  expressions,\" Owens said. \"I could kind of read her lips and know what was  going on and what she was telling her coach. I kind of already knew what was going on beforehand, so I  was just hoping she was going to get over it and be able to go out  there and perform. \"I was sick to my stomach because she wasn't able to  go out there. I know her teammates really wanted her out there, but she  made the best decision for herself, so I support whatever she does.\" After sitting out for an extended period of time, Biles returned and earned bronze in the balance beam final. That marked the seventh Olympic medal of her career. As Biles prepares to return home to the United States, Owens is trying to make the Houston Texans' 53-man roster after spending the past two years splitting time between the team's active roster and practice squad. A former undrafted free agent out of Missouri Western, Owens has played in seven career NFL games, primarily as a special teamer.",

  "body": "Justin Bieber plays the role of doting grandson in his new music video for \u201cGhost.\u201d Following the death of his grandfather, the singer reconnects with his grandmother, going on long walks with her along Ventura Beach, updating her dating profiles, and taking her out for a night of cocktails and dancing. It\u2019s a sweet story on its own, but his fictitious grandmother happens to be played by none other than Oscar-winning actor Diane Keaton\u2014the chicest grandmother one could ask for. Vogue has an exclusive look at the video, which releases tomorrow and is directed by Colin Tilley. Turns out, Bieber handpicked the style icon to star as his grandmother. \u201cHe called me up and I said, \u2018yeah, sure,\u2019\u201d Keaton tells Vogue. \u201cI thought the song was wonderful.\u201d Compared to, say, memorizing your lines and marks for a feature film, Keaton says she enjoyed the more fluid approach to acting for her first music video. \u201cThis was just sheer fun,\u201d says Keaton. \u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve been an actress and had lines, and sometimes I\u2019ve gotten to loosen them up a little\u2014but this was just completely loose and relaxed. Nobody ever [told me to do] anything, which made it so much fun.\u201d No music video\u2014even one with a heartwarming message\u2014would be complete without some looks. An eccentric style icon in her own rite, Keaton brought her own outfits (and hats!) to set. \u00a0\u201cThe outfits were indicative of my style because they\u2019re mine,\u201d says Keaton with a laugh. \u201cSome of the outfits are from my closet. I had some wonderful things from Gucci.\u201d In one scene, we see Keaton and Bieber driving in a Corvette convertible together. Keaton wears an elegant, checked Gucci coat, while Bieber wears an Aim\u00e9 Leon Dore bomber jacket with Marni pants. \u201cThat coat is really killer for me. It\u2019s my favorite,\u201d says Keaton. \u201cA coat is the greatest thing in the world for a person like me, who\u2019s kind of odd. Let\u2019s face it: I\u2019m willing to accept the fact that I\u2019m a little odd.\u201d In another scene, Bieber buys Keaton a new outfit and takes her out on the town. Justin wears a vintage rugby top and Balenciaga jeans; Keaton wears her own chic Comme des Gar\u00e7ons coat with an extra-wide belt (a Keaton signature). Even the more sombre scenes have a refined look, too. At the grandfather\u2019s funeral, Bieber wears a Saint Laurent suit, while Keaton wears a black Louis Vuitton jacket. Through it all, Keaton wears her signature dramatic chapeaus, including her favorites by Nick Fouquet, Thom Browne, and Mark Baron. \u201cI don\u2019t count my hats, but I\u2019ve kept all my old hats,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, a hat is a friend.\u201d Fabulous outfits aside, it\u2019s clear that Keaton and Bieber have a natural rapport in the clip. Keaton adds that the singer was a laid-back collaborator. \u201cHe\u2019s totally charming,\u201d she says. \u201cHe had to have his arm around me when we were walking into the ocean....If I felt like hugging him, I\u2019d hug him. He was stuck with me. I kept thinking, \u2018Oh, this poor guy.\u2019\u201d Surely, the pleasure was all Bieber\u2019s. Below, more exclusive photos from Bieber\u2019s new \u201cGhost\u201d video.",

  "body": "Growing up on Nipissing First Nation, my traditional territory, I remember that my aunties would always be cooking or making something. On my mom\u2019s side, I come from a large family of 18 aunts and uncles\u2014we\u2019re one big, loud, crazy Ojibwe family\u2014and we would often all gather at my grandmother Leda\u2019s house. There, my aunties would often be sewing or making quilts, dream catchers, moccasins, or mittens for the winter, or even regalia for those of my cousins who dance in powwows. I was brought up around the idea of maintaining traditional craftwork. Indigenous design isn\u2019t relegated to historical artifacts; traditional techniques such as beadwork, quillwork, and hide tanning are still being innovated upon and incorporated into the work of Indigenous artists today. It never dawned on me that people don\u2019t know that Indigenous goods are, yes, still being made. I recently gifted a friend a dream catcher made by my aunt, and she couldn\u2019t believe it was completely handmade. Lack of visibility has perpetuated this idea. Many Indigenous artists or designers live in remote areas and for a long time have not had the resources, or technology, to sell their work on a global scale. This is true even for my own family. While my aunties always had no problem selling their items among family members\u2014someone is always looking for something\u2014they primarily sold their work on the powwow circuit, or through good ol\u2019 word of mouth. But that\u2019s all changing now: With the rise of e-commerce and social media, not to mention global fashion weeks like Indigenous Fashion Week Toronto, it\u2019s easier than ever to find authentic, Indigenous-owned brands. The Indigenous fashion scene has grown and expanded rapidly. Now, one can now find everything from jewelry and textiles to streetwear and swimwear\u2014the through line being that Indigenous brands continue to carry on a sense of sustainability and eco-mindedness, while honoring their tribe\u2019s unique customs. With one tap on Instagram, artists can now share their pieces and provide the rich stories or context behind them, so that their consumers are educated about the piece that they are purchasing. Non-Indigenous brands have long co-opted Indigenous design motifs and used sacred elements, such as headdresses, in harmful, culturally appropriative ways; by shopping Indigenous, you are guaranteed a more respectful exchange. Seeing as how today is Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, there\u2019s no better time to get to know a few Indigenous brands. Jewelers like Robin Waynee, for instance, are fusing luxurious stones and diamonds with traditional materials. Cheekbone Beauty, Prados Beauty, and Ah-Sh\u00ed Beauty are offering eye palettes and lip gloss. Clothing brands such as Lauren Good Day or Ginew, an Indigenous denim line, are proving that traditional Indigenous design can still be contemporary. Below, shop 22 striking pieces from Indigenous-owned brands.",

We\u2019re just saying, if you\u2019ve missed wearing high heels this year, now\u2019s the time time to dust them off and bring them out again. Below, are seven ways on how to wear them. If you\u2019re not quite ready for a stiletto yet, ease in with Maryam Nassir Zadeh\u2019s Olympia wedges\u2014an eternal It girl favorite. A kitten heel is a perfect foray back into heels; stay low to the ground with a style that blends sport and glamour. Add a ladylike mule with a pop of color to counteract that cool girl vibe you have going on top. You can always keep it cute with a sweet Mary Jane to soften up an edgy look. It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve rocked a classic stiletto pump, but we say go for it. If you\u2019re not quite committed to color, let your white embellished pump do the talking.

That brimmed shape\u2014always tight fitted to the head\u2014reminds me of hats I\u2019d wear as a kid. There\u2019s something slightly infantile to them, and wearing one as an adult, I\u2019m always afraid that I look silly\u2014as though I\u2019m trying to recapture my youth or something. But for fall a number of celebrities have been wearing classic bucket hats, and I\u2019m totally changing my tune. It all started when Rihanna stepped out in New York this summer wearing Prada\u2019s nylon bucket hat in a chic seafoam green colorway. Paired with a printed top and jeans, she made it look downright cool and not at all childlike. Soon after, in September, I spotted Brad Pitt wearing a sleek all-white style to the U.S. Open, looking like the style icon that he is. Cut to Fashion Week this fall, and many VIPs were wearing them in the front rows too, including\u00a0British Vogue\u2019s\u00a0Edward Enninful, who wore a black bucket hat to many shows. He even managed to pair it with a sleek suit and look like a total boss. Prada\u2019s bedazzled bucket hats Intrigued by the accessory, I scoured the market and found that there\u2019s a number of bucket hats\u2014both by designer and affordable labels\u2014that can complete just about any outfit.\u00a0The luxe styles by Gucci, Loewe, and Prada particularly caught my eye. (What can I say? I love a designer label.) Prada, in particular, has long been a champion of the bucket hat, and as of late the label is taking its beloved nylon toppers and festooning them with sequins and stones. But even in classic black, paired with a dressier ensemble, I\u2019ve learned that the bucket adds just the right amount of extra, without going overboard. It adds instant personality to a look in a way that a dad cap simply cannot. And so what if people think you look like you\u2019re trying to dress like a teen? If the topper is good enough for Rihanna, it\u2019s good enough for all of us. Need inspiration for fall? Below, shop 13 bucket hats.",

  "body": "The other weekend, I was at a party at which a friend\u2014mid-cheerful gesticulation\u2014accidentally spilled a can of Miller Lite on my feet. At one point, this would have been a minor emergency. I might not have hissed \"Ruin my satin shoes, why don't you?\" (Cher-Horowitz-from-Clueless style), but I definitely would have been annoyed (and if I'd been wearing my agonizingly uncomfortable yet beloved Intentionally Blank cheetah mules, may or may not have cried in the bathroom). As it was, though, I was able to shrug, smile, and fix the problem with a half cup of water. This, my friends, is the beauty of wearing black platform Crocs, made of easily washable Croslite. (They're not Balenciaga or any other designer collaboration, unfortunately, but I'd be more than willing to trade up at some point in the not-too-distant future.) I have, to put it mildly, always had capital S, capital P shoe problems. Throughout my high school and college years, I agonized about the size of my calves and the width of my ankles, resolving to wear shoes with only enough of a heel to make my legs look relatively long and sinuous (particularly when they were emerging from the stringy bottom of a thrifted house dress). This resolution was hard to keep, though. Sure, I could lace up my trusty Doc Martens throughout the winter months and kick on a pair of Danskos in spring, but what about summer? What was I supposed to wear to the beach while all my friends ran around in flip-flops and cute, delicately crafted sandals, a pair of rubber tires secured with string? Luckily, I'm not quite as body-conscious now as I was when I was 19, and to put it frankly, I really don't give a shit if my shoes make my legs look thin. What I do care about, though, is comfort, and I've never really found it in socks and sneakers, which tend to make me feel like a cranky eight-year-old boarding the bus for day camp. I had a brief dalliance with oxfords a few years ago, and tried to embrace Tevas as recently as last August, but I found them to be too precious and too crunchy, respectively. Despite my improved self-esteem, I can't help it; I still have a penchant for enormous shoes, particularly the kind that actually let me\u2014gasp\u2014walk around with more ease than my Docs or Danskos ever afforded. Enter the Crocs Bae Classic Platform Clog, which I started spotting around Brooklyn on all manner of cool people sometime last year. When I heard people I trust online\u2014specifically, Vice's Sara David, platform Croc queen extraordinaire\u2014praise their walkability, I was sold. Tragically, I wasn't able to secure my own pair online until this past July due to the frequency with which they sell out online, but once they arrived at my house and I slid them onto my feet, I knew I wouldn't be taking them off anytime soon. (Okay, hyperbole. I do clean them, and I sleep barefoot, but the rest of my time is pretty much be-Crocced.)",

Today, she stepped out in New York City in a pair of Naked Wolf chunky-soled boots that skimmed her shins. She wore the statement shoes with a jacket by the Belgian label Leo, which she styled as a mini dress, an itty-bitty Herm\u00e8s bag, Bottega Veneta sunglasses, and an iced matcha tea. By her side was her beau Travis Barker, who opted for an outfit with an equally dark color palette. He wore a sleeveless black tank, black skinny jeans, and black leather shoes. Not one to skimp on accessories, the buff, bald, and tatted-up drummer wore a spiky metal necklace. (Behind him, a security guard carried a Goyard monogrammed duffle). The couple has been syncing up their style for quite some time. Kardashian in particular has put her own saucy glaze on Barker\u2019s punk aesthetic. We\u2019ve seen her in black mini dresses with cut-outs and black leather cuissardes with mini shorts. There are times when she even pulls from his wardrobe, including when she wore a grindcore T-shirt with a skeleton splattered on its front. As for this outing?

  "body": "Forget dressing up as a ghost or vampire this Halloween. This year\u2019s holiday is the perfect time to pay homage to the princess of pop, Miss Britney Jean Spears. It\u2019s safe to say we\u2019ve all been rooting for the singer these past few months, and what better way to celebrate her freedom than by paying homage to the many iconic outfits she\u2019s worn throughout her impressive career? Fear not if you\u2019re short on costume inspiration\u2014because America\u2019s sweetheart has a number of iconic ensembles that will leave you saying, \u201cGimme More!\u201d Whether in her music videos (a \u201cToxic\u201d-style flight attendant look, anyone?), on stage (you could recreate that \u201cSlave\u201d snake performance look), or on the red carpet (a denim dress rings a bell), the singer has been serving looks for two decades strong. Feeling inspired by her thrilling fashion journey, I decided that I will be dressing up like Spears this Halloween. As a lifelong fan, I know I have to do the star\u2019s signature, Y2K-style look justice\u2014so I dove into the photo archives for some ideas. And in the process, I found that there are many memorable Spears fits to choose from. So, won\u2019t you join me? From a red, \u201cOops\u201d-inspired latex suit to the \u201cBaby One More Time\u201d school girl outfit, read on below for some of the best Britney-themed Halloween costumes to consider trying on this year. You'll be the fiercest pop star in the room. Given the plethora of options, I have started encouraging my friends to come dressed as Spears for my Halloween party this year. The only rule is that there shall be no mean-spirited or 2007-era costumes allowed. In this house, we stan Spears only! As for which Britney look I\u2019m recreating? That\u2019s a secret until Halloween. Duh! Below, 6 Britney-themed Halloween costumes to try. \u201cYou\u2019re dangerous\u2014I\u2019m lovin\u2019 it.\u201d Channel Britney\u2019s \u201cToxic\u201d flight attendant look with a bright blue uniform, complete with a long, blonde ponytail and matching eyeshadow. Can\u2019t forget the headset! Recreate Britney\u2019s \u201cBaby One More Time\u201d school girl outfit with a cropped white shirt, gray cardigan, and black pleated miniskirt. Accessories\u2014like knee-high stockings and fuzzy pink hair ties\u2014are also a must. Is there a more iconic look than Britney\u2019s red latex catsuit in the \u201cOops!\u2026 I Did It Again\u201d music video? Squeeze into one (if you dare), then complete the look with a headset, high ponytail, and bright blue eyeshadow. Slither into Britney\u2019s 2001 VMAs performance look, including a bedazzled bra and bedazzled jean shorts. No need for a real-life python to go with it\u2014a stuffed toy will do just fine. For the daring Britney stan, revive her 2001 VMAs unforgettable red carpet look by wearing a black, long-sleeved lace dress, which should offer a peak\u2014just a peak\u2014at the matching lace undergarments underneath. Forget the Canadian tuxedo\u2014it's all about the denim gown. Channel Britney\u2019s 2001 American Music Awards look by rocking a denim bustier and matching long-sleeve skirt. Then, glam it up with a crystal choker and chain belt. (A date playing the part of Justin Timberlake in a denim blazer is optional, but encouraged.)",

  "body": "In the before times (pre-pandemic and social distancing), I received a care package at my New York City apartment that contained a book and a heartfelt note. It was received, out of the blue, from a friend who lives across the country and the unexpected thoughtfulness was more touching than almost any gift I had received on a birthday or anniversary\u2014holidays with a wrapped present on the itinerary. It showed me she cared, even when she wasn\u2019t obliged to, and it caused a ripple effect. Soon after, I got into the habit of sending small gifts and handwritten notes to my friends and loved ones, too. Last year, the pandemic almost instantly classified many relationships\u2014romantic and otherwise\u2014as long-distance. When lockdown began, I sent each of my sisters a set of buttery-soft pajamas to provide some comfort as they stayed inside for what ended up being months. Now, more than a year later, we\u2019ve learned the power of a thoughtful gift. Sending one irrespective of a special occasion and just because, could make all the difference in a loved ones\u2019 day. The past year taught us when physical togetherness isn\u2019t an option, phone calls, video chats, and mailed mementos are paramount. With life starting to edge back to normal, it\u2019s good to remember this sentiment. Here, 18 day-brightening best friend gifts for the special people in your life. Post-pandemic, we\u2019re investing more into our homes as work schedules fluctuate between forever-WFH to part-time in the office. Gift your friends a pretty bedside carafe to help them stay hydrated day or night while at home. Upgrade their decor (and set the mood!) with some artful, deliciously scented luxury candles. Loewe took the candle world by storm with their home fragrance launch, and now these artful iterations double as home decor. The latest beauty products from a favorite luxury brand are chic, thoughtful, and simultaneously won\u2019t break the bank. Forget the standard throw blanket, when it comes to best friend gifts an aesthetically pleasing weighted blanket can provide much-needed calm when your friends need it most. We\u2019re washing our hands more diligently than ever before. Send a friend a luxe handcare kit from Aesop that will keep their skin from getting too dry and double as decor. A great friend upgrades your workout gear. More time spent at home means you can actually stop to smell the flowers and take in the beauty of a bouquet each day. A cozy sweater that\u2019s polished enough for Zoom calls or in-office meetings makes for a wardrobe staple and a thoughtful gift. Gift cards for books or groceries are always a welcome gift. Start a long-distance book club with a friend, or give them the push to finally try that recipe you\u2019ve been talking about. Writing can be therapeutic. Leave a heartfelt note on the first page of the journal before sending it to your friend. Sometimes, the best gifts are rooted in utility. While Our Place\u2019s Always Pan has reached It-status for its multifunctional use, the brand\u2019s new pot that bakes, crisps, and steams feels like a helpful and chic gift to give a friend. As we\u2019ve recently discovered, the ultimate shoe is the slipper. Now, it\u2019s the ever-comfortable, easy-on, easy-off clog that will get just as much wear at home as it will while running errands. Take game night up a notch with a set of playing cards that force you to have memorable conversations from a distance. Plants have a lot of therapeutic benefits and add a bit of nature that (hopefully) won\u2019t perish as quickly as a bouquet of flowers. There\u2019s nothing quite like ending the day by putting on a new pair of super-soft pajamas. This pair will surely provide some extra comfort. Working from home requires extra structure. A daily planner can help them get organized. The best gift ideas for friends can be as simple as helping restore their rest each night with a silk eye mask. A handwritten note is one of the easiest (and most impactful) ways to communicate your love and gratitude to all your loved ones.",

(Who among us hasn\u2019t been tempted by the siren song of an \u201cIt\u201d product?) But the secret to finding the perfect gift, as it turns out, is more simple than you might have guessed. \u201cMen are interested in items that are purposeful and that they can use in their everyday life,\u201d explains Vogue\u2019s menswear editor Michael Philouze. \u201cThey are more pragmatic when it comes to gifting.\u201d During the past 18 months, the concept of \u201ceveryday life\u201d has been upended, which is why, as Philouze explains, the meaning and purpose of a gift matter more than ever. \u201cNotions of authenticity, intimacy, and longevity in a product feel more right for the time than ever because it is grounding,\u201d he says. To that end, Vogue has pinpointed the best gifts for men\u201448 of them, to be exact\u2014all of which have that magic combination of purpose and personality. We\u2019ve found the right gifts for an ever-changing gift-giving season\u2014from a snuggly The Elder Statesman beanie for outdoor dining to a luxe Brooklinen robe to elevate those days at home. As Philouze says, keeping gifts personal is key: \u201cWhoever you\u2019re buying for, know their style so you can buy pieces that become a part of their staples.\u201d Here, the 48 best gifts for every man in your life. \u201cTimeless pieces always make a fantastic gift\u2014something that will seamlessly weave into any existing wardrobe,\u201d says contributing menswear editor Justin Fernandez. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a wool sweater like this Howlin crewneck or a staple cashmere scarf like the cream Commissions wrap, closet essentials make an exceptional gift and are accessible for every man.\u201d These athletic gifts are a sure-fire win regardless of the sport. \u201cJust because it\u2019s getting colder doesn\u2019t mean the athletic guy in your life is staying indoors,\u201d Fernandez says. Keep the rounds of tennis going with a new Wilson racquet, or ensure his next hike is successful with Moncler\u2019s Glacier boots. WFH blues? We\u2019ve got just the fix. \u201cLight up this Cire Trudon candle around the home,\u201d Fernandez says. \u201cCandles do extraordinary wonders on lifting spirits.\u201d So, too, does a well-tailored Brooklinen robe and a buttery-soft A.P.C. quilt. Island escapes and countryside getaways are slowly making a return. Ensure all of his upcoming travels are a breeze with functional gifts like a Prada water bottle or Rag & Bone duffle. Whether he has a newborn puppy or a racehorse, he\u2019s sure to appreciate a gift that makes time with his furry friends even more fun. \u201cAt the end of the day, I always enjoy gifts that have a purpose, and I will actually use,\u201d explains Fernandez. Imagine him walking Fido with a Prada collar around his neck or saddling up on this beautiful green saddle. As Fernandez says: \u201cSometimes it\u2019s the little things in life. Just because it\u2019s more expensive, doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s better. These affordable gifts speak volumes.\u201d",

Over the years, I\u2019ve found the biggest successes were those small pleasures they didn\u2019t know they needed or a thoughtful something that reminds them of the gift-giver\u2014an item that recalls a memory you both shared, like a bottle of wine from the region you last visited together. Whether it\u2019s delicious olive oil, a record player, or a classic cashmere sweater, there is nothing more rewarding than surprising Mom or Dad with a gift that they will use and love for years to come. We\u2019ve narrowed down the best kitchen upgrades, home goods, accessories, and more to make sure you find the perfect gift for your closest of kin. Below, 36 of the best gifts for parents who have everything. Your parents are sure to love millennial favorites like the Always Pan or Great Jones pot. They have a following for a reason and are a great addition to any home cook\u2019s existing collection. There is nothing like a beautiful Japanese chef\u2019s knife to inspire one to get into the kitchen, and Diaspora Co.\u2019s spice collection will only advance their culinary creations. If your parents are anything like mine, they\u2019re intrigued by all things wellness. They can up their healthy cooking game with Little Gypsy Farm\u2019s olive oil or the cult-favorite Beast Health blender. If they are more in need of some relaxation, a chic meditation pillow set or Theragun\u2019s Smart Bluetooth Wave Roller will do the trick. A Sonos record player or Loewe candle is an easy way to elevate any space for parents who love to spend time at home. A CB2 marble checkers board or leather magazine holder is ideal for a hobby-enthused Mom or Dad. Plus, everyone loves unique home upgrades like this beautiful bolster pillow from Christina Lundsteen or a modern Hay throw blanket. If Mom and Dad prefer to host at home, colorful tabletop pieces like the below serving tray and tumblers will definitely spark joy. A chic apron is a necessity for any host, and a Georg Jensen-designed barware set makes serving drinks feel even more fun. Any mom will cherish a classic handbag, like this Tory Burch shoulder bag, or a gorgeous Lizzie Fortunato necklace. You can also never go wrong with cashmere, which makes this Vince sweater a great choice. Shearling Birkenstocks and a Naadam scarf complete the cozy look. I know I will be sporting my Venetian furlane slippers this holiday season\u2014so why not get Dad a pair to match? Any father would also enjoy a handsome new duffle bag, like this one from Alex Mill, or a Charvet tie to keep him looking sharp.",

The visual display spotlights all of finalists of the fashion fund: Abrima Erwiah of Studio 189, Batsheva Hay of Batsheva; Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta of Eckhaus Latta; Anifa Mvuemba of Hanifa; LaQuan Smith; Rebecca Henry and Akua Shabaka of House of Aama; Kenneth Nicholson; Jameel Mohammed of Khiry; Edvin Thompson of Theophilio; and Willy Chavarria. Visitors to the installation will see special pieces on display and scan a unique QR code to learn more about each designer. For many of these designers, this installation marks the first time their wares are showcased on such a platform. \u201cI grew up in midtown Manhattan. I was born and raised just two blocks from Nordstrom, where this installation will be held. I have seen this block change over time and I remember when Nordstrom first opened,\u201d says designer Abrima Erwiah of Studio 189. \u201cImagine the feeling for myself, my community, my family to be in our neighborhood and to see Studio189 at Nordstrom! It\u2019s a huge accomplishment!\u201d LaQuan Smith echoes this excitement, and for him, it\u2019s a new avenue to reach a new audience. \u201cI think this exhibition will help to educate the consumer on the brand and who our customer is and what she stands for.\u201d The Nordstrom installation marks the culmination of year-long programming for the 17th edition of the annual CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund. Historically, the fund was a competition with three label-winners, but in 2021, things were switched up, and grants and mentorships were awarded to all of the 10 finalists. \u201cIt is going to change a lot about my business\u2014especially getting to work with my amazing mentor Jenna Lyons. I am learning so much!\u201d says Batsheva. The best way to continue supporting these young American designers?

  "section": null,
  "body": "Tailoring is firmly back on the agenda this season, as many of us return to the office following months on end of WFH. Currently on our inspo boards? Emily Ratajkowski and Kendall Jenner, who are mastering the art of oversized suiting. But while both women are known to be fans of The Row, it\u2019s actually an emerging vintage brand that\u2019s behind some of their best tailoring looks to date. Havre Studio, founded by Madeleine Frandsen at the start of pandemic, has fast gained a cult following of its one-of-a-kind men\u2019s suits, which are restored and refitted for its primarily female customer base. \u201cIt\u2019s [all] happened really by chance,\u201d Frandsen, whose designs have also been seen on the likes of Elsa Hosk and Imaan Hammam, tells Vogue. \u201cI moved to Mexico City with my boyfriend in late 2019 and stumbled across some tianguis (open air markets), where they sell used clothes. So I scavenged through those because I\u2019ve always loved flea markets and then I started taking some of the suits I bought to a seamstress. We would practice Spanish together about twice a week and we\u2019d kind of experiment with these old men\u2019s suits.\u201d At first Frandsen, who now lives between Mexico City and her home in Copenhagen, was upcycling the suits for herself. But when she started getting interest from her friends, the business student launched an Instagram account, where she would take orders via DM. \u201cIt was very much a passion project to begin with,\u201d she explains. When the pandemic broke out, Frandsen wondered how she could support the seamstresses she\u2019d developed friendships with. \u201cI [was working with] three seamstresses at that point, and they just lost all their income from one day to another,\u201d the designer says. \u201cSo we decided to see if we could sew more suits. Fortunately, there\u2019s been demand for it and we\u2019ve managed to scale up production and hire more people.\u201d Currently, Havre Studio sells its refitted suits in regular drops (the last sold out in 10 minutes), with cropped blazers and mini skirts, as well as contrasted suit jackets, featuring in its offering. \u201cWe tried to experiment a bit with the silhouettes,\u201d Frandsen remarks. \u201cI remember cropping a blazer just because I thought it looked nice when you can see the waist, and then we [made] a skirt with the rest of the residue fabric. I think there\u2019s something about taking something so classically masculine and making it a bit feminine.\u201d Sustainability, too, is at the heart of the brand\u2019s zero-waste ethos, and definitely part of the appeal for customers. \u201c[These] men\u2019s suits were made to last: men had them tailored especially for them; they have their names in them,\u201d Frandsen says. \u201cPeople like that the pieces are unique, they have a story, but also, of course, [people like] the quality and the fact that it\u2019s sustainable and made properly.\u201d Havre Studio hopes it can continue the tradition via its refitted vintage suits. \u201cI really want to make something that you\u2019re going to have for ages and maybe even pass down day,\u201d Frandsen concludes.",

  "body": "Consider this a formal apology to the maxiskirt: I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve maligned you all these years. Truth is, growing up in Texas in the late 2000s, I had just seen too many bad takes on the style. Remember those billowing turquoise-and-coral chevron maxiskirts? Paired with a chambray shirt and\u2014of course\u2014a chunky statement necklace? I even wore a white-and-blue striped maxiskirt for my senior portraits, making the bold decision to wear it with a blue-and-white striped Ralph Lauren polo shirt. So I hope you understand why it took a long time to regain an appreciation for the look of the ankle-length skirt. But I\u2019ve succeeded in replacing it with another, more sophisticated image: specifically, Stella Tennant in an ad campaign for Jil Sander in spring 1997. In the black-and-white campaign, she wears a tee I assume is gray and a black maxiskirt that hugs her backside and thighs just so to create an elegant curve. The ensemble is punctuated by kitten heels and slicked-back, boyish hair. It\u2019s the antithesis of the loud maxiskirts of the 2010s; it\u2019s so quietly elegant it\u2019s almost painful. This style was popular in the mid to late 1990s, when simplicity reigned supreme. Of course it made an appearance at Jil Sander (search \u201c90s minimalism\u201d on Pinterest, and you\u2019ll likely find Tennant in the first 10 scrolls) and also at Chanel in fall 1998, Prada in spring 1997, and again at Jil Sander in fall 2002. Our Lady of \u201990s Minimalism, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, was partial to long, mid-calf, or ankle-length skirts. Who can forget the image of her in a full-length black Calvin Klein skirt with a white Yohji Yamamoto oxford top? I can\u2019t, and it\u2019s enough to erase the memory of coral-colored chevrons. Not all of these are knit maxiskirts, but I find that fabrication to be the best bet when channeling this particular mood. They\u2019re comfortable and formfitting in all the right places and can work for a lot of different occasions. Years ago, I stopped by the wonderful (and now sadly defunct) boutique Anthom in SoHo and tried on a black knit maxiskirt from Mijeong Park that hit just at my ankles. It hugged every curve beautifully and flared out just right from my knees to make a kind of trumpet-like silhouette. Worn with a T-shirt and a pair of sneakers, I felt like a personalized version of the late Tennant in those Jil Sander ads. This fall it\u2019s become my foolproof outfit formula. A basic black style is sexy enough on its own for me\u2014Mijeong Park no longer makes my particular style, but this Aya Muse version is quite similar. Should you want something a bit hotter, there are options on the market that have extreme leg slits (Simon Miller) or midriff floss (Christopher Esber). Worn with a corset and chunky flatforms, it\u2019s ready for a night out. Worn with a chunky sweater, I feel like Meg Ryan in You\u2019ve Got Mail. Okay, she didn\u2019t technically wear a formfitting knit maxi, but I think it fits the vibe of an Upper West Side small-bookstore owner. Only instead of going from enemies to lovers with Tom Hanks, I\u2019m extending the olive branch to maxiskirts. Shop some of my favorites below.",

But it was Curtis\u2019s costume that stole the show.

You remember that iconic scene; The one where she\u2019s stabbed to death in the shower by Norman Bates. (You may hear the scene as well). Curtis wore a bright blue, buttoned-up dress and a pert blonde bob. Just in case you missed the reference, she carried a blood-soaked shower curtain. For a film as scary and gruesome as Halloween Kills, designed to scare the daylights out of the audience, Curtis nailed her equally-eerie red carpet approach. Plus, Leigh was a scream queen in her own right, so it\u2019s only natural that Curtis carry on her legacy.",

  "body": "No matter the occasion\u2014and especially around the holidays\u2014it\u2019s important to celebrate those women nearest and dearest to you with a carefully chosen gift. From a pocket-size luxury to a thoughtful token, a gift, no matter the cost or scale, can show someone that you\u2019re thinking of them. Shopping for a fashion enthusiast? Who could refuse a new padded cassette bag from Bottega Veneta or cozy-chic shearling slides from JW Anderson? Looking for something for someone who takes pride in their well-stocked beauty cabinet? They\u2019ll surely delight in a limited edition lipstick. Still feeling overwhelmed? You can\u2019t go wrong with something classic, like a pair of leather driving gloves or a gold bauble and a luxe velvet jewelry box to stash it in. A thoughtful gift will go a long way, maybe with a lovely, handwritten holiday card too. All these ideas and 48 other incredible gifts for women, below. Finding that perfect holiday gift may seem daunting, but rest assured, these gifts have earned the title of classic for a reason. Sophie Billie Brahe\u2019s emerald green jewelry box is practical but not at all boring, while Monbouquette\u2019s twinkly colored stone drop earrings will leave everyone, quite literally, beaming. And you couldn\u2019t go wrong with timeless leather gloves or a pair of snuggly bed socks perfect for holidays spent at home. No matter what type of cosmetics enthusiast she may be, she\u2019ll most certainly fall hard for any one of these beauty goods, like Westman Atelier\u2019s palette of lip colors or Pat McGrath\u2019s glittering mini smokey eye kit. Should you want to spoil her, Cartier\u2019s Les Collections de Parfum or Dyson\u2019s limited edition AirWrap set are the perfect gifts to do so. It can be a challenge to shop for someone with particular tastes, but some items are guaranteed to make any fashion fan smile. Consider Gucci\u2019s logo print pajamas in joy-inducing shades of holiday colors or Saint Laurent\u2019s off-duty baseball cap. Alternatively, who could resist Bottega Veneta\u2019s cassette bag in their signature padded leather and chain strap? Both kitchen newcomers and cooking aficionados would appreciate a few chic culinary supplies or accoutrement to stock their kitchens. Let Serena and Lily\u2019s four-piece cheese serveware set spruce up her charcuterie boards and a printed apron is sure to make any chef smile. Or delight her with Bordallo Pinheiro\u2019s charming set of dessert plates\u2014and bring her her favorite treat\u2014for the full effect. How to impress the best gift-givers you know? Take a page out of their books and delight with something unpredictably unique. Bode\u2019s custom cord notebooks are completely one-of-a-kind; if you wish to have one made, you\u2019ll need to do some leg work. And no two of Re/Done\u2019s upcycled sleeveless cardigan sweaters or Rentrayage\u2019s tote bags are the same. If organic, small-batch, or naturally made are common words in her consumer vocabulary, she\u2019ll love a surprise shipment of natural wine varietals or artisanal and organically grown box of California mushrooms\u2014delivered with the exquisite level of presentation you can expect from Flamingo Estate. Winter scarves, hats, and gloves are always a no-fail idea. After all, we all wish for a white Christmas, and what better gift is one you can use right away. For immediate satisfaction, let her unwrap Acne Studios\u2019 classic mohair scarf or Max Mara\u2019s wooly teddy mittens. However, the must-have winter wear of the season is sure to be Gabriela Hearst\u2019s Chloe collaboration with Moon Boot. Whether she shops sustainably or you\u2019re looking to shop more responsibly, these conscious but covetable gifts for women make it pretty easy. Consider Nike\u2019s running shoe, made of plastic bottles and scraps, Laura Lombardi\u2019s recycled brass hoops, or Stella McCartney\u2019s cute and cruelty-free handbag made from 100% vegan materials.

Everyone had big ambitions about producing less, using what exists, and designing clothes to last: Francesco Risso was upcycling old pieces into new ones; Gabriela Hearst and Stella McCartney used up their leftover fabrics; Balenciaga\u2019s Demna Gvasalia sharply increased his use of organic cotton and recycled synthetics; Kenneth Ize and Colville partnered with artisan weavers in Nigeria and Mexico; and Collina Strada launched a \u201csilk\u201d made from rose petals. On our mid-pandemic Zooms, these were often the details designers got most excited about: Gvasalia recalled deconstructing and upcycling his own clothes during lockdown, telling Vogue\u2019s Sarah Mower it helped him fall in love with fashion again. \u201cThere\u2019s a need to revise things,\u201d he said. \u201cTo start a new chapter.\u201d We expected spring 2022 to be another step forward, a glimpse of fashion\u2019s earth-friendly future after 18 months of lockdowns and climate disasters. Often, though, the general feeling was that brands were more focused on the media impact of their shows than the environmental impact of their collections. \u201cRemember sustainability?\u201d a colleague laughed at New York Fashion Week. After a year-and-a-half of lofty conversations around the subject, its absence felt abrupt, if not troubling. In truth, there was a lot vying for our attention this month. The sheer excitement of getting back to live shows was powerful, even if many of us experienced them virtually. These weren\u2019t just regular shows, either: They were music festivals, TV premieres, and community gatherings, each transmitting good vibes IRL and on Instagram. Fashion\u2019s big comeback seemed to demand a show that made an immediate, emotional impact, sometimes to the point where the clothes became secondary to the plot. When a show is no longer about the clothes, there isn\u2019t much space to dive into the nitty-gritty of organic yarns and local manufacturing.",

If you\u2019re planning to embark on a workwear-friendly wardrobe overhaul, shirting is a solid starting point. Look to soft materials to ease your way back into something resembling desk-side polish \u2013 we love styles from With Nothing Underneath and Simone Rocha \u2013 and for those of us who are ready to embrace some form of structure, then a trusty blazer looks both stylish and smart. Make The Frankie Shop your first port of call: the neutral shades are a Vogue editor favorite. As for the Zoom-worthy trophy jewelry that saw us through lockdown? That can stay. After all, what better to way to make an entrance than with an eye-catching necklace? Here are Vogue\u2019s favorite office clothes for women. Blazers can smarten up even the simplest of looks. Find a style that fits well on your shoulders, and ensure that the length of the hemline and sleeves are just so. If you\u2019re yet to find the perfect pair of trousers, let Vogue\u2019s selection be your first port of call. Remember: You can always tailor a pair that aren\u2019t spot on. No back-to-work outfit is complete without a shiny new pair of shoes. Loafers are the footwear shape of choice among the street-style set: the preppier, the better. White shirts will forever be a classic wardrobe staple, but why not try a trendy color like zingy green or chocolate brown? Your colleagues will be asking for your outfit details. You\u2019re wrong to think that dresses should be reserved for summer. With the right styling, certain dress styles can take you from day to night in an instant.

Today, we polled Vogue\u2019s editors and heads of content for their reactions to the spring 2022 season. Read on to discover their standout collections, the newcomers that have caught their attention, and their impressions about the return of IRL shows. Anna Wintour, Global Editorial Director and Editor in Chief Vogue US Which newcomer are you most excited about, and why? Everyone here at Vogue in New York was very much engaged with Peter Do\u2019s runway debut: a reminder that the city has designers who can really produce fashion with a capital F that\u2019s also wearable with a capital W. And while he\u2019s hardly a newcomer, Telfar Clemens\u2019s constant challenging of all the hoary old industry norms and standards\u2014his latest is Telfar TV\u2014is impressive. What trend or trends from the Spring 2022 collections is most resonant for you? I wasn\u2019t so much struck by the notion of trends but by the collective push, from so many talented individuals\u2014Tom Ford, Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, Francesco Risso, Demna Gvasalia, Jonathan Anderson, and Sarah Burton (I got to preview it while I was in London!)\u2014who are really energized and galvanized by thinking about fashion as we emerge from the pandemic. None of them see the act of designing as business as usual\u2014and they\u2019re right to do so. What did fashion learn from a year-and-a-half of lockdown? What does it still need to improve on? It learned that we really need runway shows to be more reflective of the world and how people look in it. At the risk of sounding self-congratulatory, New York continued to do a terrific job in terms of inclusivity and body and age diversity. (I had a young European designer in my office the other day who said the very same thing to me.) But there\u2019s still so much room for improvement; the industry\u2019s continuing obsession with thinness is plainly wrong and just needs to stop.",

  "body": "To appreciate the history of Chanel handbags, one has to start with the origins of the purse itself. For the society ladies of Western Europe in the 18th century, bags were effectively pockets, detached from garments and worn around the waist with a band beneath layers of skirt. By the end of the century, however, narrow neo-classical silhouettes could no longer camouflage a pocket, so it became a visible purse: a pochette with looped handles. This went on for about a century and a half before Gabrielle Chanel came along and thought, Can\u2019t a girl get something hands-free? And thus, the chain-strapped crossbody bag came into fashion. In 1909 the House of Chanel was born, founded by the elegant yet swashbuckling Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel. Though she\u2019s best known for her nubby boucl\u00e9 jackets, she started off making accessories\u2014hats, to be exact\u2014at a millinery shop on Paris\u2019s Rue Cambon. As it so famously goes, her Catholic orphanage upbringing instilled in her a unique appreciation for the austerity of the ecclesiastical garb of nuns. (Her rearing with the sisters of the Sacred Heart of Mary in Aubazine, France, stopped short, however: It\u2019s believed that Gabrielle\u2019s frequent dalliances with aristo men introduced her to jersey fabric, then a textile for men\u2019s undergarments.)",

Spotted today in New York, the designer and former Spice Girl hit the streets wearing a bright, colorful look\u2014and subtle it was not. The star fused neon-bright hues together in a color combination rarely seen since 2013. In case you forgot, color-blocking gained major legs back in the early 2010s, when labels such as Raf Simons, Prada, and Gucci began showcasing runway looks that mixed shades like bright yellow and purple together. Beckham herself even experimented with color-blocking in her label\u2019s fall and spring 2012 collections\u2014albeit in more muted tones. Wearing Crayola-bright pieces in one outfit was a fad that burned bright, but fast. The look went out of style after a few seasons. However, it's slowly making a comeback, as seen on the runways at Louis Vuitton, Valentino, and Bottega this season\u2014and Beckham seems to be in favor of the movement. For her own chic take on the trend, Beckham wore a red top with bright yellow trousers, both from her own label. She then finished off the bold ensemble with a bright green Bottega Veneta Cassette bag. The trio of primary colors made her look like she stepped right out of 2011, though the outfit\u2019s sleek proportions helped modernize it. Are you ready for the return of in-your-face colors? Perhaps channel her energy and think about incorporating one\u2014maybe two\u2014zingy colors into your look. Three, if you dare.",

  "body": "Stepping into Eva Joan is akin to going inside an upcycling jewelry box. To the left of the door sits a rack full of acid-wash jeans, floral frocks, paper-thin nightdresses, and antique quilts, piled high to the ceiling. To the right, trays of ribbons, bowls of buttons, and a cadre of pins and embellishment. Everything is on display with one goal in mind: to transform any garment in any way. No project is too big, and it\u2019s enough to change how you think about alterations entirely. Bjorn Eva Park, 28, and Emma Villeneuve, 29, opened up Eva Joan in a half address at 22 8th Avenue next to Casa Magazines in the West Village in June 2021. Filled to the brim with vintage fabrics, trims, buttons, and embroideries, its goal is to inspire customers to use patches and embroidery to repair their old favorite pieces or create new ones. The duo have transformed wedding dresses, biker jackets, and a Hungarian textile passed down through generations into new creations, re-knitting ex-boyfriends\u2019 cardigans and embroidering polka dots over damaged areas along the way. The concept is simple, but brilliant. Save your garments in the most creative way possible. \u201cWe just aren't in the business of hiding the journey of a garment,\u201d adds Park. \u201cA dress three times salvaged with visible stitching and your grandfather\u2019s leather patch is a lot more exciting to me than something that looks like it\u2019s never been worn. Hopefully we are telling a bigger truth of what it means to own our own stories.\u201d Eva Joan\u2019s approach to repairs undoubtedly relates to the greater upcycling and sustainability movement in fashion. Park\u2019s experience working as a production designer and Villeneuve\u2019s background as a set decorator brought them together after years of painting, quilting, and designing complicated backdrops by hand in a pre-pandemic world. After a trip to Marfa, Texas, where both were questioning what it would mean to live a more sustainable life, Eva Joan was born. The duo mined basements, gas stations, and fishermen\u2019s closets in Louisiana to find the accoutrements that now line their shop, taking the same approach their grandmothers took to mending when they were growing up. So, they decided to name the shop after Park\u2019s grandmother, Eva, and Villeneuve\u2019s grandmother, Joan. \u201cEva is the ultimate mender. There was not a thing of my childhood that wasn\u2019t reinterpreted to have more magic,\u201d explains Park. \u201cJoan on the other hand was obsessed with celebration and personalized everything in her life,\u201d says Villeneuve. \u201cShe could make a holiday out of a trip to the grocery store. Joan instilled in me a reverence for detail that justified spending three months on an eight-year-old\u2019s Halloween costume. Eva and Joan were the original eccentrics.\u201d",

  "body": "\u201cWe might stay a bit afterward,\u201d he murmurs to a colleague: He anticipates a large swarm of attention. The conference where Rousteing is speaking now is not about fashion; it is called Fighters Day, and it\u2019s a gathering of French entrepreneurs in the American mold: techies, start-up doyens, and \u201cself-made\u201d men and women of the kind who, until recently, scarcely existed in the French\u00a0imagination. Onstage, in French, Rousteing speaks about his decision to set off on his own at 18\u2014the first of several daring choices that shaped his path. \u201cI left my fashion school after six months,\u201d he says. \u201cI fought because I had no school or background behind me, just determination and desire. I came to Paris, and it\u2019s now 10 years since I\u2019ve been creative director at Balmain.\u201d He adds, softly, \u201cIt\u2019s always a battle against yourself.\u201d The day\u2019s unofficial motif is battling the odds outside the self, which has been a theme of Rousteing\u2019s public life. A Black man reared in Bordeaux by two middle-class white parents, he is the highest-ranking person of color at the old Parisian houses, and he sits among two other business figures on the panel, also chosen for unusual paths: There\u2019s Aminata Diouf, a former nanny who created the placement and training service Gribouilli, and Anthony Bourbon, a formerly homeless young man who started the meal-replacement shakes, bars, and powders company Feed. The panel is in Station F, a former freight center converted into a sleek start-up campus off Paris\u2019s techie Quai d\u2019Austerlitz. The audience is young, diverse, and multitalented, but Rousteing brings something distinct: an understanding of the way taste, creativity, and business intersect. \u201cFor me it\u2019s been very important to use clothes to talk about subjects such as diversity and \u2018pop\u2019\u2014pop culture, population,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started my Instagram in 2013, I had a meeting with my president, who asked, \u2018What are you doing? Luxury on Instagram is impossible. It\u2019s cheap.\u2019 \u201d Since Rousteing\u2019s wild ascent began, he has understood himself as an avatar of new paths: long hours, broken barriers, direct access, success beyond the old sclerotic elite channels. But recently, he\u2019ll tell me later, he has wondered whether something has been lost in the gloss and glamour of ambition he has cultivated, and he\u2019s started breaking barriers of a more personal kind. \u201cYou have to embrace your fury,\u201d he tells the crowd now. \u201cBut you also have to surround yourself with people who take care of you.\u201d The keystone of this new effort, for Rousteing, has been the documentary Wonder Boy, by the filmmaker Anissa Bonnefont, which focuses on Rousteing\u2019s fraught, heartbreaking efforts to learn the story of his birth parents. When it came out on Netflix in June, it was avidly watched in France, a success that local observers found unsurprising. \u201cOlivier is one of the most followed fashion designers in France, if not the most followed,\u201d Pierre A. M\u2019Pel\u00e9, himself a leader among the generation of French fashion journalists to reach prominence through online followings, recently said. \u201cHe understood very early on that social media and the digital sphere were inherent to the future of fashion\u2014that it wasn\u2019t just about shopping online but communicating directly with your audience. The reality is that people are hungry for fashion content, but also for more personal content: They want to know who is behind the brand, and about people\u2019s lives. I blame this on the boom in reality TV over the past decade.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut that\u2019s what Olivier understood and has committed himself to.\u201d Almost from the start, Rousteing had anti-elite ambitions: Reach beyond the domain of the fashion industry, he thinks, and you can summon pop-scale audiences When Balmain\u2014the only Parisian couture house to be endorsed by Gertrude Stein\u2014opened in 1945, it seemed the incarnation of France\u2019s smart, chic, internationalized postwar glamour. Pierre Balmain dressed Sophia Loren, Josephine Baker, Lady Astor, and the queen of Thailand. He combined trim tailoring with gorgeous flows of cloth to create strikingly proportioned profiles\u2014eye-catching but modest, refined but unfussy\u2014that came to be associated with the style called Jolie Madame and set a consumer standard for high fashion. After he died, in 1982, the house moved through the visions of other designers, changing all the while. There was Oscar de la Renta, who presided starting in 1992 and carried Balmain\u2019s classicism into the new millennium. There was the upscale reimagination of glam rock by Christophe Decarnin, under whom Rousteing joined the house, in 2009. When Rousteing ascended two years later, during a reshuffle following Decarnin\u2019s sudden departure, he combined mass-market pragmatism (most of Rousteing\u2019s collections include some pieces with a body-con, Saturday-night accessibility; he counts his 2015 collaboration with H&M among his proudest achievements) with a certain stridency of form and cut (he has been un-shy about strong patterns, angular cutouts, and, in one collection, a printed wolf-pack motif). \u201cHe represents the good in fashion\u2014energy, passion, and fun,\u201d says his fellow designer Kim Jones, who leads menswear at Dior and women\u2019s at Fendi. Some say it\u2019s easy to miss how deeply rooted in a distinctly French idea of craft Rousteing\u2019s garments are. \u201cPeople tend to think he\u2019s, you know, a white girl from L.A., but there\u2019s a lot more than that to it,\u201d M\u2019Pel\u00e9 says. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that things can be incredibly well-made while remaining accessible visually\u2014it\u2019s almost an idea of the new French elegance.\u201d",

  "body": "While we\u2019re still in the early stages of fall, several street style trends have emerged and taken hold. We paid close attention to who wore what during fashion month, and there seems to be a clear consensus on five must-have essentials for this season. Fashion-show attendees couldn\u2019t wait to pull out their cozy knits, especially long, ankle-grazing maxidresses. From New York City to Paris, we saw it all: rainbow crochet frocks, minimalist-approved sheaths, and peekaboo and midriff-baring designs. In the same comfy vein, constricting skinny jeans were MIA\u2014oversized, baggy silhouettes reigned supreme. Those loose-fitting denim pieces paired well with everything, from turtlenecks to zip-up jackets to (another uber-popular trend) tuxedo vests. Take a closer look at all of the coveted street style trends below. And don\u2019t forget to shop out your favorites before it\u2019s too late. What\u2019s the easiest way to give last season\u2019s jackets and blazers a 2021 makeover? Sport them with a head-turning pair of pants. From painted to patchwork designs, street style stars have all seemed to join the statement-trouser movement. Even if you\u2019re no longer staying home all day wrapped up in a blanket, you can still recreate the cozy moment. These knit dresses are just as pleasant to wear but offer an elevated finish that will bring in several compliments. Give your legs some wiggle room with this fall by securing a billowing pair of jeans. Style tip: Look for shapes with tapered ankles or roll the hem for a polished, instead of slouchy, finish. If you haven\u2019t already jumped on board with the microminiskirt trend, now\u2019s the time. The transitional weather means that there\u2019s still plenty of time to get a few more wears out of those summer minis. A tailored blazer, knit cardigan, or color-block parka will instantly turn them into seasonally appropriate items. Hit refresh on your fall suit by swapping blazers for sleeveless vests. If the weather isn\u2019t too chilly, go shirtless underneath for instant cool-girl flair.",
