Police chiefs aren't happy.", "author": "By Simone Weichselbaum, Emily R. Siegel and Andrew Blankstein", "section": null, "body": "In the months after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, public defenders in Virginia saw an opportunity to overhaul policing in the state. Among their key priorities to address racial disparities: a ban on traffic stops for such infractions as broken taillights, tinted windows and the aroma of marijuana. What happened next stunned police officials across Virginia. In just three months, the ban the public defenders pitched to Democratic legislators sailed to the governor\u2019s desk and was signed into law. With Covid-19 shutting down the state Capitol and forcing the legislative sessions to take place via Zoom, the law enforcement officials who objected to the bill had failed to galvanize the opposition. In March, Virginia became the first state to prohibit the kind of low-level traffic stops that disproportionately affect people of color and are often used as pretexts to search for drugs and weapons. An NBC News analysis of the early data shows that the measure is having an impact on the percentage of Black motorists searched by police during traffic stops. \u201cAs public defenders, we aren\u2019t exactly used to winning, let alone winning big,\u201d said Brad Haywood, the chief public defender for Arlington County and executive director of Justice Forward, a criminal justice reform organization made up of public defenders across the state. \u201cThis will dramatically reduce race-based policing and impact so many lives.\u201d Long a cornerstone of American law enforcement, the traffic stop has emerged as a flashpoint in the debate over police reform. Over the last 20 months, district attorneys in California and Minnesota have ordered prosecutors to drop cases in which officers found guns or drugs during traffic stops for minor infractions. Other states, including Washington and Massachusetts, are considering restrictions similar to Virginia\u2019s. Proponents describe the measures as a long overdue step in banishing a tactic that targets mainly Black drivers and fails to improve public safety. But many law enforcement officials argue that they\u2019re being stripped of a crucial tool that they say helps to reduce vehicle deaths and remove criminals, guns and drugs from the streets, although the police chiefs and sheriffs interviewed for this article struggled to provide data backing up their case. Maggie DeBoard, the chief of the Herndon Police Department in Virginia, said stripping police of the ability to make certain traffic stops will make the roads more susceptible to traffic accidents and create fewer opportunities for officers to encounter people who should be off the streets. \u201cWe are eliminating more and more interactions with criminals by not allowing us to enforce the laws that are on the books,\u201d said DeBoard, who was the president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police as the group fought the bill. \u201cA lot of times you stop a vehicle, you have no idea the race, color, creed, religion of the person you're stopping,\u201d DeBoard said. \u201cYou see a violation, you stop the car. And at night, you definitely don\u2019t know who you\u2019re stopping. So it is not about targeting.\u201d Virginia started collecting detailed traffic stop statistics only in June 2020. The early data suggest that the law is having some effect on how the roads are policed. In the first four months after the law was enacted \u2014 March to June \u2014 the number of overall traffic stops rose by 7 percent compared to the previous four months, which experts said isn\u2019t surprising given that warmer weather tends to attract more drivers to the roads. But the number of motorists subjected to searches after having been pulled over \u2014 the category that the reformers care about most \u2014 dropped sharply, according to an NBC News analysis of police data obtained in a public records request. The number of Black drivers who were searched fell by 40 percent, and the number of white drivers dropped by 30 percent, the data show. Black people still accounted for about 30 percent of all traffic stops \u2014 the same percentage as before the law was changed \u2014 even though they are about 20 percent of the population of Virginia. White people, who make up 65 percent of the population, accounted for slightly under 65 percent of the stops before and after the law was changed, the early data show. Da\u2019Quan Marcell Love, the executive director of the Virginia NAACP, said the decline in the number of searches of Black drivers shows that the reforms are broadly working. But he said advocates are waiting to see how the situation plays out in the long term. \u201cWe have to give it time to work,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe are not launching a celebration any time soon.\u201d Officers stop about 20 million drivers a year, according to federal estimates, for reasons from speeding to blowing through reds light to expired tags. The vast majority of the encounters last only a few minutes and result in tickets or warnings, research shows. Police across the country have long been criticized for using minor infractions such as broken taillights as reasons to stop motorists and investigate them for possible crimes. Criminologists and civil rights lawyers have panned the tactic as a fishing expedition rife with racial bias that yields few results. Frank Baumgartner, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed more than 24 million traffic stops across North Carolina from 2002 to 2020. He found that the encounters led to arrests about 2 percent of the time. Searches also rarely occurred, and when they did, weapons were discovered in one-tenth of 1 percent of incidents. Black people were the subjects of nearly half the stops, Baumgartner found, even though they are only 21 percent of the state\u2019s population. \u201cFor every one bad guy they catch, they alienate, like, 18 young Black men,\u201d Baumgartner said. \u201cThat's where we get to the crisis of trust with the police.\u201d That type of traffic stop led to two of the highest-profile police killings in recent years: those of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Both were Black men who were shot and killed by officers after having been pulled over for broken taillights. Officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder of Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked coast-to-coast calls for reform. Faced with overwhelming public pressure, elected officials are increasingly moving forward with measures to strip away police powers regardless of whether law enforcement leaders support them. Last month, the top prosecutor in Ramsey County, Minnesota, where Castile was killed, announced that he would no longer prosecute  most cases that stem from non-public-safety traffic stops, such as expired tags. He cited the disproportionate impact on people of color, especially Black people, among other reasons. \u201cThe outcome of these stops is that it yields very, very little contraband,\u201d said the prosecutor, County Attorney John Choi. \u201cIf I thought that this would lead to more problems from a public safety perspective, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Larger police departments in Choi\u2019s county supported the move, but the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association described it as \u201cinsulting.\u201d More statewide bans may be on the horizon as politicians continue to openly shrug off opposition from police. Inspired by the change in Virginia\u2019s law, Joe Nguyen, a Democratic state senator in Washington, recently introduced legislation that would prohibit police from pulling motorists over for failing to stop, driving without licenses and other violations. \u201cWe passed a few bills last year that didn\u2019t have law enforcement support, so it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of,\u201d Nguyen said. Some police chiefs across the country, in places like Oakland, California; Minneapolis; and Portland, Oregon, have retooled their traffic enforcement policies to avoid unnecessary confrontations with drivers. The Oakland Police Department issued a directive five years ago discouraging officers from pulling people over for low-level offenses like equipment violations and expired registrations. Since the policies were put in place, the percentage of Black drivers who were stopped fell from 62 percent in 2016 to 51 percent in 2019. The police department enlisted Stanford University to examine its data, which showed that under 3 percent of stops in 2013 and 2014 were linked to more serious crimes. Deputy Police Chief Christopher Bolton urged Oakland police brass reluctant to reform to take a hard look at the statistics. \u201cWhy are we continuing to do those stops when the data is showing that not only is it not effective and efficient, but it could very well be damaging public trust and confidence in what our strategies are?\u201d Bolton asked. But in San Francisco, District Attorney Chesa Boudin\u2019s push to end \u201cpretextual\u201d traffic stops has met fierce resistance from the police. During his second month in office, Boudin told staff members to refrain from prosecuting people who were stopped for minor infractions and found to have \u201ccontraband,\u201d including drugs and guns. Union officials slammed Boudin for creating an environment in which criminals feel comfortable to break the law without fear of punishment. \u201cIf they want to continue to handcuff the police in doing their jobs, the unintended consequences are going to be more crime victims,\u201d said Tony Montoya, the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Union officials blame Boudin\u2019s new traffic policy for the release of a man who was accused of fatally shooting two people weeks after he was pulled over and found with an assault-style rifle without a serial number. The district attorney\u2019s office said its decision not to pursue charges against the suspect, Robert Newt, had nothing to do with the circumstances of the stop. The investigators didn\u2019t provide DNA or fingerprints that could tie Newt to the gun, Boudin\u2019s office said. Rachel Marshall, a spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office, said the policy \u201coffers room for exceptions.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office said it has rejected about one to two cases a month because of Boudin\u2019s rules, for a total of 11 this year. \u201cRacial profiling undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and fosters distrust in communities of color \u2014 all of which decreases public safety,\u201d Marshall said. Police chiefs and sheriffs in Virginia say that the state\u2019s ban went too far and that it is putting lives at risk at a time when murders and fatal accidents are already soaring. The original bill, in fact, would have gone even further by blocking police from stopping vehicles with no front lights. The governor\u2019s office cut the measure after Chesterfield County Police Chief Jeffrey Katz blasted it in a viral Facebook post. The new law permits a driver to have one broken headlight. \u201cLawmakers were making decisions based on the loudest voices in the room, but not necessarily the most informed voices in the room,\u201d Katz said in an interview. \u201cAnd all you have to do is look at the crime rate in the last year and a half.\u201d As in many other states, the number of murders in Virginia has risen sharply since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Virginia State Police. Even though officers can still cite people for speeding and erratic driving, rural county sheriffs said the ban creates an atmosphere in which reckless motorists feel safe to break the law, and they warned that traffic deaths will rise. Fatal traffic accidents in the six months after the law was changed hit a 10-year high, according to an NBC News analysis that compared them to the same period going back to 2011. Jessica Cowardin, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said the rise in traffic deaths mirrors national figures, which are also up. Federal officials blame the increase on speeding, drunk drivers and people who don\u2019t wear seat belts \u2014 violations that police in Virginia can still enforce. For some Virginia police chiefs, the concerns go beyond traffic accidents. In Petersburg, about 20 miles south of Richmond, officers confiscated more than 1,000 guns in the three years leading up to the ban, often in vehicle stops, Police Chief Travis Christian said. But his office was unable to provide data backing up the claim. The analysis of arrest data found that weapons were discovered in about 7 percent of traffic stops in Petersburg from 2018 to 2020. As a chief who is Black, Christian said he is \u201ctorn\u201d over the new law. He acknowledged that Black Virginians feel targeted by police when they are behind the wheel, but he said he still wants the ban reversed. \u201cIt has given us the ability to use it as an investigative tool to get to other crimes that have been committed,\u201d Christian said. \u201cThat tool has been eliminated for us.\u201d David Weisburd, a criminology professor and the executive director of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, said he wasn\u2019t aware of any data that support the claim that low-level traffic stops help to reduce crime. \u201cIt is time, in my view, for the police to bring evidence to their arguments,\u201d Weisburd said. \u201cThat evidence could help in deciding what is reasonable or unreasonable or what is good policing from what is awful policing.\u201d The new law hasn\u2019t put an end to controversial stops in Virginia. Five days after the ban went into effect, state troopers pulled over Juanisha Brooks, 35, a Black woman who is a senior video producer for the Defense Department, as she was driving along a highway in Northern Virginia. A trooper ordered her to get out of the vehicle several times, saying he wanted to show her what was wrong with her car. Brooks refused, saying she didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t tell her while she remained in the vehicle. Dashcam video appears to show the trooper dragging Brooks out of the seat and pushing her up against her car. Officers charged her with reckless driving, eluding, obstruction of justice and failing to have her headlights on. Prosecutors dropped the case, noting that the stop was illegal because of the reforms. Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, insisted that the arrest was fair because Brooks refused to comply with the trooper\u2019s commands. State Police conducted an internal investigation; Geller said she couldn\u2019t share whether the trooper was disciplined because of privacy rules. \u201cI was afraid for my life,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be another hashtag.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ems-services-warn-crippling-labor-shortage-undermining-911-system-rcna2677", "title": "EMS services warn of 'crippling labor shortage' undermining 911 system", "subtitle": "\u201cWe\u2019re not bleeding any longer \u2014 we\u2019re hemorrhaging,\u201d one ambulance service operator said of a decadelong worker shortage exacerbated by the pandemic.", "author": "By Phil McCausland", "section": null, "body": "The pandemic-induced shortage of emergency medical technicians and paramedics nationwide is so dire that ambulance service providers warn of sharp cuts to services and longer waits for 911 calls \u2014 even when it\u2019s a matter of life or death. Companies have had to close, consolidate or come up with new strategies to answer calls, said American Ambulance Association President Shawn Baird, who added that there is simply not enough EMS personnel to cover calls in many parts of the country, especially during the pandemic. The loss of staff to pandemic-related burnout and low wages has created a vicious cycle, requiring greater dependence on those workers who have stayed on. The situation has deteriorated to such a degree in recent months that ambulance services and industry leaders are pleading with Congress and state legislatures to help. \"The magnitude has really blown up over the last few months,\" Baird said. \"When you take a system that was already fragile and stretched it, because you didn't have enough people entering the field, then you throw a public health emergency and all of the additional burdens that it put on our workforce as well as the labor shortages across the entire economy, and it really has put us in a crisis mode.\" It's a crisis that has made it difficult to hire and even harder to retain EMTs and paramedics, according to a AAA survey of 258 EMS organizations across the country. In 2020, nearly a third of the workforce left their ambulance company after less than a year, the survey said. Eleven percent left within the first three months. \"It's almost unmanageable,\" said Ken Cummings, who leads Tri-Hospital EMS in Port Huron, Michigan. \"I don't think any EMS provider wants to go out in public and say that your service might be interrupted, but the reality is that because of the extremely low workforce situation right now, we are going to start to see delays. We're already seeing that throughout the country right now.\" Cummings said he currently has 10 openings, about 10 percent of his workforce. He's currently paying double overtime to fill the gap left by those empty positions, but that has increased the average work week of his paramedics by at least eight hours. The amount of money he's paying in overtime is also becoming untenable, and his workers are losing interest in the extra cash. \"We're spending money today that we're hoping we get tomorrow, to be real honest with you,\" he said. \"It's not a long-term solution.\" There are an estimated 1,000 open EMS positions in Michigan alone, Cummings said. The good news for Cummings is that he has a handful of students who will graduate next year from the paramedic program, but the churn is constant. The Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, also agreed to allocate $12.9 million of the state's budget to increase reimbursement rates. But that has not slowed the revolving-door nature of the job. Among full-time EMTs, 47 percent reported in 2020 that the reason for leaving was for a career or occupation change, according to the survey. That number is 45 percent among paramedics. \"In my experience running an EMS service, I've seen more than a few employees get into the industry and leave within six months,\" said Judd Smith, the program director of Texas EMS School in Abilene. \"I'll see people work for three weeks and then move on to the next thing.\" The decline in Texas has been particularly substantial. By mid-August, only 27 percent of licensed EMS professionals had submitted a patient care record, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, meaning that over 70 percent of licensed Texas EMTs did not work on an ambulance in the first eight months of the year. That represents a significant drop from the 43 percent of EMTs who submitted reports in 2020 and the 45 percent who did in 2019. The circumstances have pushed the American Ambulance Association and National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians to send a letter to Congress last week pushing for a hearing to address the shortfall and asking for more funding to increase wages. The letter warned that \"our nation\u2019s EMS system is facing a crippling workforce shortage, a long-term problem that has been building for more than a decade. It threatens to undermine our emergency 9-1-1 infrastructure and deserves urgent attention by the Congress.\" The pandemic has made a bad labor problem worse. The spread of the virus, the frequency of calls, worry of potential infection and the necessary safeguards that emergency personnel must take to protect themselves have created additional stress that has caused many to leave the field, providers said. Their departure has then increased the need for those who remain to work overtime, pushing even more to leave the field. The nationwide health emergency also caused many EMT and paramedic courses to shut down, meaning there is a dearth of students coming into the industry. \"We're not bleeding any longer \u2014 we're hemorrhaging,\" said Gary Wadaga, who operates Bay Ambulance in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Ambulance companies have faced years of workforce challenges that has damaged their ability to respond to calls quickly, but the situation is getting worse. Last year, because an ambulance service closed south of his company's service area, Wadaga had to take on an additional 100 square miles of territory. Now he covers 1,500 square miles and receives about 1,000 calls a year with six paramedic positions. The trouble is, he's been unable to fill two spots and has another two workers on leave, leaving him and one other person to respond to every emergency call that comes in. \"I've not seen it this bad in 41 years, and you can't just set that aside,\" said Wadaga, adding that the increasing demands of the job have caused him great anxiety. \"You want to be there for your community, but the fact that one day we're not going to have enough people absolutely bothers me.\" Ambulance companies once had the luxury of considering applicants, but that appears to be a concept of the past. Now companies are actively recruiting and even going after one another's employees because the pool of eligible workers is so small. \"Overall, it's robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Baird, \"because every community needs these folks.\" Wadaga and other ambulance service operators said the pandemic has increased the viciousness of a labor shortage and put the nation's emergency medical system at risk of a \"death spiral\" that could be difficult to pull out of. The salary requests of a shrinking workforce are getting higher as wages remain stagnant. The 2020 median pay for EMTs and paramedics was $36,650 per year or $17.62 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about a 7.5 percent increase since 2011. Advocates said the wages don't match the requirements of the job anymore. \"When you're an EMS provider putting your life on the line and entering into a closed environments with infectious patients and you can make more money to work in an Amazon warehouse, it becomes really difficult to retain people,\" said Robert Luckritz, who serves as chair of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians' EMS Workforce Committee. But it's not just retail and warehouse work that's calling. Luckritz said that hospitals facing their own nursing and health care worker shortages are at times actively recruiting EMT and paramedics, promising higher wages, better hours and increased benefits. That's an issue Luckritz and his colleagues are attempting to work on, but it's a challenge. They need more money to hire more people, but ambulance company rates are set by insurance providers and the government when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, which both contribute to the vast majority of calls, Luckritz said. \"Unlike much of the other industries across the country ... we're not able to raise our prices \u2014 our prices are set by the government,\" he said. \"So with reimbursement not keeping up with our costs, it makes it very difficult for us to compete for the workforce.\" The fear is that if the country doesn't face these problems now, they will be unfixable down the line. Baird, the AAA president, said that if things spiral too far down, \"we can\u2019t get people to even enter the field because it looks too daunting.\" \"We have to turn this around,\" he said. One silver lining is that online EMS programs, such as Smith's Texas EMS School, are seeing increased interest \u2014 even as nationwide there is a decline in enrollment in traditional programs. The number of applications for their EMT program, which can be completed in 10 to 18 weeks via a mix of online coursework and hands-on clinical and field experience, jumped from 495 applicants in 2019 to 1,469 in 2021. The jobs certainly are there waiting for them at graduation. \"I don't know of any one of our students that doesn't get hired within the first week of getting licensed,\" Smith said. \"We've even had a big number of them get hired before they even received their certification, so they start working as soon as they're done.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-stake-2022-hopes-child-cash-benefits-there-s-just-n1281142", "title": "Democrats stake 2022 hopes on child cash benefits.

But in doing so, they planted an election-year time bomb for their own party, and their only realistic hope of defusing it in time is to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s social spending bill. At the center of the American Rescue Plan is a monthly payment structured as a tax credit for the vast majority of families \u2014 of $300 per child under 6 years old or $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. The benefit has been well received in polls, and studies say it quickly lifted millions of U.S. kids out of poverty. But there\u2019s a catch: It is only authorized for 2021. The payments end in December unless extended. With Republicans opposed, the only realistic vehicle to extend them is Biden\u2019s multitrillion-dollar bill, which Democratic leaders are working feverishly to craft. Allowing the payments to expire would risk erasing the economic gains and leaving struggling parents who have come to rely on it in the lurch. Democratic operatives warn it could turn a significant political asset into a liability just months before an election in which Republicans are historically favored to make gains. \u201cLetting the extremely popular child care tax credit expire would be exactly the type of mistake we can\u2019t afford,\u201d Tyler Law, a Democratic consultant who worked for the party\u2019s House election arm during the 2018 blue wave, said. \u201cDemocrats need to deliver win after win after win to show voters we can govern and deserve to stay in power,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet for success, but there\u2019s certainly a recipe for disaster: failing to pass the Biden agenda.\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the child tax credit has had a major impact in alleviating poverty and held it up as an example that says Democrats, when in charge, can help Americans. \u201cThe idea of letting it expire, I think, would be horrific,\u201d he said. While Democrats battle over what provisions make it into the bill, they appear to agree unanimously that the money for kids should be extended \u2014 from centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., to progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. But the details are unclear. The House version of the bill extends the payments through 2025. That may be adjusted as lawmakers sort out how to cut down the plan's price tag to get the centrists on board. And the income threshold for who is eligible may be adjusted as Manchin has demanded additional means-testing for the various programs in the bill. \u201cThere's some differences of opinion about how to do it, and how long to fund it, etcetera. And it has to fit within the overall top line of the bill,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. \u201cBut every Dem really wants it to happen.\u201d Republicans are adamantly opposed to the program and say it should expire. \u201cThe federal government shouldn't be in the business of just handing out money because you have kids,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said. \u201cThat's ridiculous.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Democrats of \u201ctrying to build a permanent welfare class in the country,\u201d saying the child tax credit includes \u201cdistributing more borrowed money to people who don't have a need for it.\u201d Some Democrats are spoiling for that fight. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the party\u2019s House campaign arm, projected confidence that Democrats will pass the bill, extend the child cash payments and then run on them. \u201cWe're going to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact that the Republicans have opposed it at every step of the way will come back to haunt them. I believe that it's exactly that type of thing that is the anvil on which we will hammer them in 2022.\u201d Sean McElwee, a progressive pollster who has been cited by the White House, said his firm has found that voters who received the child cash payment approve of Biden's job performance by a wide margin of 66 percent to 32 percent, whereas voters who haven't gotten it split evenly with 49 percent approving and disapproving. The firm, Data for Progress, found that those who voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020 and who receive the child tax credit register 79 percent disapproval of Biden, whereas 92 percent of those who do not receive it disapprove of the president. \u201cEnding the child tax credit would risk washing away these key persuasion gains that will be necessary to win in 2022 and 2024,\u201d McElwee said. Overall, the child cash payments are supported by 59 percent of U.S. adults, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. That includes 75 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of Republicans. Some of the states with the highest average per-month cash payments are conservative states. Progressives cite the program as an example of how government can make Americans' lives better. \u201cWe already have powerful data showing us that this tax credit is reducing hunger in America. It's providing school shoes and backpacks for kids to be able to go back to school,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u201cWe need to protect this \u2014 not just because it expires in an election year. We need to protect it because this helps American families.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/squid-game-entertaining-world-there-s-different-feeling-south-korea-n1281119", "title": "'Squid Game' is entertaining the world.

Because everyone else is. The nine-episode horror series on Netflix has hit No. 1 in 90 of the streaming service\u2019s markets around the world, including South Korea, where it was made. \u201cI got to the point where I could not hold a conversation without watching the show,\u201d said Jung Dunn, a security analyst in Seoul, the South Korean capital. But the show also strikes a nerve because it unflinchingly addresses a problem that is particularly entrenched in South Korea: debt and the never-ending struggle to pay it off. The cast of \u201cSquid Game\u201d features some of South Korea\u2019s biggest stars, including Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist, Seong Gi-hun, a hopelessly indebted father who receives a business card from a stranger offering him a way out. Along with 455 other contestants \u2014 from all walks of life but all deeply in debt too \u2014 he agrees to compete for a cash prize of 45.6 billion won (about $38 million) by playing a series of traditional Korean children\u2019s games, only to discover that elimination from each round means death. \u201cThere\u2019s this dissonance between Korean pride that this Korean show is dominating Netflix all around the world, and the discomfort with what the show appears to expose about Korea,\u201d said CedarBough Saeji, an assistant professor of Korean and East Asian studies at Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea. \u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing.\u201d That South Korea also produced \u201cParasite,\u201d the 2020 Oscar winner for best picture that also focused on themes of inequality, has probably accentuated this discomfort, Saeji said. Still, \u201cSquid Game\u201d is wildly popular in its home country. The show was released on Sept. 17 just before Chuseok, a Korean holiday similar to Thanksgiving when families gather, the perfect time for binge-watching. The surge in network traffic led one internet service provider to sue Netflix to cover its costs. The fervor has also spilled over into real life. A street vendor in Seoul who provided the makers of \u201cSquid Game\u201d with dalgona, a brittle sugar candy at the center of one of the games, told Reuters that he had seen a boom in business. Thousands of curious South Koreans also tried the eight-digit phone number that appears on the business card, which the show\u2019s makers didn\u2019t realize would reach an actual person. The owner of the number, and even people with similar numbers, have been inundated with calls and messages at all hours. On Wednesday, Netflix said it was working with the show\u2019s local production company to address the issue, including editing scenes to remove the number. Park Sae-ha, a senior studying economics at Yonsei University in Seoul, said \u201cSquid Game\u201d was \u201cspell-binding because it was so explicit and blunt.\u201d \u201cAlthough I am young, I could easily relate to the hard reality of a very competitive society,\u201d she said. That intense competitiveness may be one reason South Korea has been so successful, with a period of rapid industrialization starting in the 1960s that turned it into the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. But as in many other countries, a university degree and a white-collar job don\u2019t guarantee the financial security they used to, Saeji said. With an average income of about $42,000 a year, many Koreans now find they have to borrow to keep up. Fueled by low interest rates, household debt in South Korea has grown significantly in recent years, and is now equal to the country\u2019s annual GDP. (In the U.S., by contrast, household debt is about 80 percent of GDP.) People may rack up debt because of credit card spending, unemployment or gambling losses, but a large chunk of it is tied to real estate. Housing prices have been rising fast, especially under President Moon Jae-in, and the average price of an apartment in Seoul is nearing $1 million. Lending curbs and efforts to cool the housing market have done little to rein in household borrowing. In addition to housing, some Koreans, especially young people, borrow money to invest in cryptocurrency. Many Koreans start out by borrowing from legitimate financial institutions like banks, said Koo Se-Woong, a commentator on Korean culture based in Germany. When that avenue is exhausted, they may move on to second-tier lenders that charge higher interest. In the worst-case scenarios, he said, borrowers turn to loan shark operations that can charge triple-digit interest rates, \u201cand then you are pushed into situations from which you really cannot get out.\u201d According to some estimates, there are 400,000 Koreans in debt to loan sharks. \u201cWhen you look at the characters in the show who are participating in this game, they represent that demographic of the Koreans who are in the worst possible situation because of their personal debt,\u201d Koo said. In a recent widely shared Facebook post, Koo said he was shocked when a friend told him he was living paycheck to paycheck, despite having a good job. The friend \u201cdoesn't strike anyone as extravagant,\u201d Koo said, but struggles to afford the trappings of middle-class life: an apartment, a car and occasional travel with his wife and children. \"It's all paid for by loans, I am telling you,\" Koo said his friend told him. \"We just have no money.\" Jung, the security analyst, said the plot of \u201cSquid Game\u201d was easy to accept because \u201cit dealt with such familiar stories of debt-ridden people you come across in real life.\u201d \u201cThe story stems from a deeply rooted perception of how society looks at failure, especially individual financial failure,\u201d he said. Bankruptcy in South Korea is generally seen not as a chance to start over but as a devastating fate. That is underlined in \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Saeji said, when contestants are given the option to leave but choose to keep playing even at the risk of their lives. \u201cIn the regular world it\u2019s not just the death of their body, it\u2019s the death of their pride. It\u2019s the shame of having to be such an unsuccessful person in front of your family,\u201d she said. Viewers in South Korea say the show is all the more disturbing because it injects death and violence into playground games like Red Light, Green Light and tug of war. The show plays on childhood nostalgia \u201cand along with it the innocent times when you had no problems,\u201d said Kim Hern-sik, a pop culture critic in Seoul. \u201cYet the story tells you that escaping from reality is not the answer.\u201d \u201cSquid Game\u201d is \u201cfundamentally a Korean story, featuring games people would remember playing as kids,\u201d Don Kang, vice president of Korean content at Netflix, told NBC News in an email. \u201cSo we knew it would resonate with our members here.\u201d Its popularity in the West came as more of a surprise. But Korean cultural exports have been sweeping Asia for years, and Netflix was already betting on their growing appeal. The company is spending $500 million this year on Korean content, almost as much as it spent in the last five years. Saeji said that after decades of Western cultural influence, the success of \u201cSquid Game\u201d shows that South Korea can make a TV show with a Hollywood feel \u201cand they can do it better.\u201d While \u201cSquid Game\u201d is not the first story about a fight to the death, director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who has a film degree from the University of Southern California, made it influential in his own way, said Oh Dong-jin, a prominent film critic in South Korea. \u201cEvery movie borrows this and that from other movies. What matters, therefore, is how creatively you can borrow from different references,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, even from this standpoint, the traditional children\u2019s games the show uses make 'Squid Game' quite original.\u201d Margie Kim, a housewife in Seoul who is watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d with her family, said that while she enjoyed its intensity and pop-art-influenced visuals, the underlying messages were also important. \u201cI do feel the pain of what our society is going through,\u201d she said. The show deals with so many pressing issues, she said\u2014income inequality, youth unemployment, a rapidly aging society\u2014that it\u2019s something her entire family can relate to and talk about. \u201cSo many middle-class, ordinary people live with so much debt,\u201d she said. \u201cI could totally empathize with people who joined the game.\u201d Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Stella Kim reported from Los Angeles.", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/working-companies-owned-well-heeled-private-equity-firms-can-mean-n1281146", "title": "Working for companies owned by well-heeled private-equity firms can mean lower wages for employees", "subtitle": "Workers at some fast-food chains owned by public firms are getting better wages now. It\u2019s a different story at restaurants owned by private-equity firms.", "author": "By Gretchen Morgenson", "section": null, "body": "Alma Jordan, a certified nursing assistant at the Marcella Center nursing home in Burlington, New Jersey, respected the residents she cared for there over the past 16 years. They were like family, she said, and she believes they\u2019ve appreciated her attentiveness, especially during Covid-19. Not so, the nursing home\u2019s new owner, Jordan said. After Complete Care Management, the largest for-profit nursing home operator in New Jersey, took over the 150-bed Marcella Center in April, it slashed worker benefits, she and other employees as well as a representative from their union told NBC News. Amid the pandemic, Jordan\u2019s paid holidays were reduced, and her monthly health insurance costs more than tripled, she said. The company stopped contributing to the employee pension, replacing it with a 401(k) plan that had no employer match or contribution. Complete Care took away vision insurance and stopped a reimbursement program covering employee education costs, so Jordan, 45, won\u2019t be able to recoup money she spent working toward a degree to become a licensed practical nurse. \u201cI put all my effort into this company, and someone else took over and they don\u2019t want to give us what we deserve,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s business. It\u2019s not about the staff and the residents. It\u2019s only about making profits.\u201d In late September, Jordan quit her position at the facility. The reduced benefits and deteriorating work conditions got to be too much, she said. When Complete Care came in, Jordan and other Marcella workers were operating under a union contract struck with the facility\u2019s previous owner. Complete Care did away with that contract, which also covered four other unionized New Jersey nursing facilities it recently acquired, according to the Service Employees International Union. Complete Care owns 61 facilities in eight states, including Connecticut, Maryland and Wisconsin. It is backed by a private-equity firm called Peace Capital in Lakewood, New Jersey, whose principal owner is Sam Stein. Jordan and her fellow workers are not alone in experiencing reduced circumstances after their company is taken over by a private-equity firm. The new titans of finance, these firms use large pools of debt \u2014 typically raised in what's called the leveraged loan market \u2014 to acquire companies they hope to resell in a few years at a profit. Among companies raising money in this loan market during the past three years, debt levels at private-equity-backed entities were at least 30 percent higher than debt levels at companies not backed by private equity, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. But the heavy debt loads they take on, combined with pressure to flip acquired companies quickly, increases the likelihood that private-equity firms will have to cut costs in the operations that they buy. Often, the first to the chopping block is the company\u2019s workforce. A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research lays this out. Researchers analyzed almost 10,000 debt-fueled buyouts between 1980 and 2013 and found that employment fell by 13 percent when a private-equity firm took over a public company. Employment declined by even more \u2014 16 percent \u2014 when private equity acquired a unit or division of a company. Eileen Appelbaum is an economist and co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, and co-author of \"Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street.\" Her study of private equity has led her to conclude that the industry\u2019s growing clout is not only a concern for workers, but also has the potential to harm the nation\u2019s broader economy. \u201cYou have a lot more ownership of productive resources by investors who don\u2019t know an industry, don\u2019t understand the value of skilled workers and who are just in it to make their profit and get out,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cThat erodes productivity.\u201d Almost 12 million employees, or roughly 7 percent of the U.S. labor force, work for private-equity-backed businesses, according to the American Investment Council, an industry lobbying group. These companies generated about 6.5 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product last year, the group said. The council said private-equity firms create jobs, support businesses and help provide comfortable retirements for pensioners invested in the strategy. A spokeswoman for Complete Care echoed this view. She said the company is committed to the long-term viability of its facilities, adding in a statement: \u201cWe offer a comprehensive health plan and competitive benefits, and our facilities are known as great places to work.\u201d The company is negotiating a new union contract, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, though, care at the Marcella facility is declining, Jordan said, days after she quit. \u201cWe were very short-staffed,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think the residents pick up on that because it takes longer to answer a call.\u201d In a statement, a spokesperson for Complete Care said, \u201cComplete Care at Marcella consistently maintains state mandated ratios. ... We take whatever measures necessary to ensure that we have proper staffing to meet the needs of those in our care, including bringing in agency staff and offering bonuses as needed.\" Private equity is a sophisticated investment strategy that has grown furiously in recent years. At the end of last year, assets under management at the firms worldwide stood at $5 trillion, up from $1.5 trillion over the past decade, according to Preqin, a financial data provider. The number of funds devoted to these activities has more than doubled during that period, and last year, private-equity firms paid some $600 billion to acquire companies, up from $250 billion 10 years earlier. Private-equity firms began their climb to power in the 1980s; then they were known as leveraged buyout shops, because of the debt they use. The $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988 by private-equity giant Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts brought such deals to center stage. In recent years, as prevailing interest rates collapsed, private-equity operations have been able to take on greater amounts of low-cost debt to make their acquisitions. Through Sept. 27, for example, $472 billion of leveraged loans were issued, up from $237 billion issued during the same period in 2019, according to LCD of S&P Global. Outside investors, such as public pension funds and endowments, pour money into these takeover deals in the hopes of generating high returns. But recently, as the stock market has roared, outsize returns in private equity have all but vanished, academic studies show, and they are now in line with overall market performance. Nevertheless, more companies are owned by private-equity firms now than trade on the nation\u2019s stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, private-equity firms\u2019 rising dominance has generated immense wealth for their executives. The value of Sam Stein's holdings in Complete Care could not be determined and the company declined to provide it, but it is almost certainly dwarfed by those of Stephen Schwarzman, head of Blackstone Group. A close adviser to Donald Trump during his presidency, Schwarzman is worth $35 billion, according to Forbes magazine, up from $15 billion in 2020. Private equity also benefited from recent government interventions related to the Covid pandemic, documents show. At least $5 billion in federal bailout money went to companies backed by large and well-capitalized private-equity firms, according to a recent report from Americans for Financial Reform. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board launched an unprecedented $750 billion program to prop up the corporate bond market, where many of these firms raise money for their buyouts. Among the bonds purchased by the Fed, documents show, were those issued by Blackstone and another private-equity giant, Apollo Global Management, founded by Leon Black. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently testified that the agency would increase its scrutiny on fee disclosures and conflicts of interest among private funds, to ensure their practices don't put investors in these strategies at a disadvantage. And Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a late September memo outlining the agency's priorities that \"the growing role of private equity\" invites an examination of how these firms' business models \"may facilitate unfair methods of competition and consumer protection violations.\" Finally, the Democrats\u2019 proposed tax increase on capital gains may crimp private-equity executives\u2019 earnings. A key reason many of these executives have been able to amass such fortunes is that so much of their earnings are taxed as capital gains with a top rate of 20 percent, not at the higher 37 percent rate that can apply to income. This is a benefit they've tapped for decades, often allowing them to pay a lower tax rate on earnings than a secretary or a teacher might. One of the nation\u2019s biggest private-equity employers is Roark Capital of Atlanta. It owns Inspire Brands \u2014 parent company to an array of fast-food chains that includes Arby\u2019s, Dunkin\u2019, Baskin-Robbins and Sonic \u2014 and other brands such as Cinnabon and Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee. NBC News estimates that more than 700,000 people work at Inspire Brands, many at independently owned franchise stores. Roark is named for the libertarian protagonist in \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d by Ayn Rand, whose life \u201cexemplified the qualities of independence and integrity,\u201d the company\u2019s website said. One of libertarianism's basic tenets is limited government, but three dozen companies owned by Roark obtained $183 million in federal assistance under the CARES Act, according to the Americans for Financial Reform report. Asked whether this acceptance of government funding ran counter to a limited government stance, Roark declined to comment through a spokeswoman. Zella Roberts, a recent graduate of Warren Wilson College near Asheville, North Carolina, worked as a carhop at a Sonic Drive-In earlier this year to help pay tuition. Her all-in pay plummeted during the pandemic, Roberts told NBC News, because customers\u2019 cash usage fell and Sonic did not allow tips on credit cards. Roberts said she and some colleagues sent an email to Roark Capital \"explaining the conditions that Sonic workers experience. The big ask was to put pressure on Sonic corporate to make these changes.\" She said she never heard back about that or other messages sent to Neal Aronson, managing partner and founder of Roark Capital. Aronson is the controlling owner of Roark, regulatory filings show, which has $18.6 billion in assets under management. Through a spokeswoman, Aronson declined to comment. In January, after Roberts had collected 7,800 signatures on a petition asking Roark to change its policy, the company allowed tips on credit card orders placed through its app. An improvement, Roberts acknowledged, but such orders are a small percentage of those made via credit cards, she pointed out. The Inspire Brands spokesman said barring tips on credit cards \u201cis a technology limitation that we inherited when we purchased the brand\u201d in 2018. \u201cWe are now working on implementing the credit card tipping capability,\u201d he said. Inspire Brands has also worked to battle the Raise the Wage Act, which has been introduced in Congress every year since 2017 and would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour among workers like Roberts. In March, Inspire sent a memo to franchise owners highlighting its lobbying success in opposing the change. Describing its efforts, Inspire said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you\u2019re on the menu, and you can guarantee your opponents are eating!\u201d Chris Fuller, a spokesman for Inspire Brands, said the company fought the national minimum wage legislation because \u201cwe don\u2019t support a one-size-fits-all approach to the minimum wage. We believe in letting the local markets dictate.\u201d He added: \u201cMore than 90 percent of our team members at corporate-owned restaurants are above the state or local minimum wage.\u201d Some Inspire Brands workers have taken matters into their own hands. This summer, Matthew Honeycutt, 18, was working at an Arby\u2019s in Charlotte, North Carolina, making $9.50 an hour as a shift manager. He supports an 8-month-old son. On July 20, he and a group of workers walked off the job seeking a pay raise, forcing managers to close the Arby\u2019s store two hours early, Honeycutt said. That got management\u2019s attention, he said. \u201cThe strike was on a Tuesday, and it was about Thursday when he started getting the raises out,\u201d Honeycutt said of his boss, who gave him a 50-cents-an-hour raise. \"Every kind of worker you can think of is working so hard, but they're not getting paid what they\u2019re worth.\" Honeycutt\u2019s boss did not respond to a voicemail message seeking comment. In mid-September, Honeycutt quit his job at Arby's for a higher-paying position elsewhere. While Inspire Brands fights against a higher minimum wage, some other restaurant companies owned by publicly traded companies are taking a different approach. They say increasing worker pay is good for business. In February, Robert Verostek, the chief financial officer of restaurant chain Denny\u2019s, told investors that paying a higher wage to its workers in California had resulted in \u201cnot just positive sales, but positive guest traffic.\u201d And in May, McDonald's began increasing pay by 10 percent for almost 37,000 workers in company-owned stores. Shift managers like Honeycutt, who earned $10 at Arby\u2019s, are earning between $15 and $20 an hour depending on the location, McDonald\u2019s said. Sean Dunlop, an equity analyst at Morningstar Research, said Inspire Brands is a well-managed company. But increasing pay and benefits among workers is an industry trend it won't be able to resist. \"As you\u2019re thinking about bigger chains, not only are they making a broader push to a $15 average wage at restaurants, you\u2019ve also seen them offer tuition assistance, paid time off, retention bonuses and referral bonuses as they\u2019ve been trying to attract workers,\" Dunlop said. \"Inspire Brands, if they want to compete, are going to be forced to raise wages. They're going to have to, whether they want to or not.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/silicon-valley-area-food-banks-strain-under-growing-logistical-needs-n1281047", "title": "Silicon Valley area food banks strain under growing logistical needs of poverty", "subtitle": "\u201cInfrastructure requirements have sorely taxed the charitable food system at a time when demand is still extraordinarily high,\u201d one expert said.", "author": "By Cyrus Farivar", "section": null, "body": "RICHMOND, Calif. \u2014 On a recent unseasonably warm October day, dozens of Californians gathered at a food distribution site on a vast, unshaded blacktop space behind an elementary school. In one hour, 193 people waited patiently to fill their carts and shopping bags with produce like bell peppers, apples, onions and squash from the side of a massive truck. \u201cThat\u2019s a record for this year,\u201d said Matthew Durkin, 30, the mobile distribution supervisor, while nodding at the clients and noting that he usually sees only about 160 people. \u201cIt means there\u2019s an increased need.\u201d Durkin, of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, says that while demand for free food has slowed slightly from the start of the pandemic, people are still hungry. \u201cWe have seen another jump in numbers within the last few months. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, adding that many clients have told them how much they fear returning to work. \"They are concerned about Covid-19 surges, as so many of us are, and some of them may need to stay available for unexpected changes in child care and school due to Covid exposures or cases.\u201d More than 18 months into the pandemic, San Francisco Bay Area nonprofit organizations, from food banks to shelters for domestic violence victims, say that they are seeing more demand for their services than they ever saw before the pandemic. Even now, there are still two members of the California National Guard working at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties\u2019 central warehouse in Fairfield. As the pandemic drags on, these support facilities are also struggling with supply chain problems to meet the seemingly endless demand. It presents even more challenges as supplies and workers grow more scarce. Joel Sjostrom, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, has watched the food bank\u2019s demand grow to 300,000 people at the height of the pandemic from 178,000 before the pandemic began. He is now still trying to find support for 240,000 clients each month. Almost immediately after the March 2020 shelter-in-place order was instituted, he said, his organization lost 35 percent of its volunteer workforce because it depends so heavily on older volunteers who were scared to work before they were vaccinated. He had to call in members of the California National Guard, two of which remain. \u201cTo meet those volume increases, we have had to step up facilities and transportation,\u201d Sjostrom added. \u201cI had heard of the National Guard being helpful to others in Southern California.\u201d At one point, there were as many as 25 soldiers working to help this one bank. In California, the National Guard, as of Thursday, still had 140 soldiers deployed to food banks across 16 counties, down from a high of 767 in April 2020, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan M. Shiroma, a California National Guard spokesperson. But the National Guard is gradually trying to cut those numbers back and deploy these workers to other missions. In addition to help from the National Guard, Sjostrom has hired more full-time staff. But even now, even with 16 drivers, he still would like four more \u201cClass A\u201d drivers who can operate big rig trucks. In order to stay competitive with other outfits that employ drivers, he said he has had to raise his rates from $28 per hour to $30 per hour. \u201cIt\u2019s truly market pressure,\u201d Sjostrom said. \u201cAmazon has ads out, as does Hello Fresh, and driver demand is everywhere.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/traffic-stops-are-flashpoint-policing-america-reformers-are-winning-big-n1280594", "title": "Police face a 'crisis of trust' with Black motorists.

Police chiefs aren't happy.", "author": "By Simone Weichselbaum, Emily R. Siegel and Andrew Blankstein", "section": null, "body": "In the months after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, public defenders in Virginia saw an opportunity to overhaul policing in the state. Among their key priorities to address racial disparities: a ban on traffic stops for such infractions as broken taillights, tinted windows and the aroma of marijuana. What happened next stunned police officials across Virginia. In just three months, the ban the public defenders pitched to Democratic legislators sailed to the governor\u2019s desk and was signed into law. With Covid-19 shutting down the state Capitol and forcing the legislative sessions to take place via Zoom, the law enforcement officials who objected to the bill had failed to galvanize the opposition. In March, Virginia became the first state to prohibit the kind of low-level traffic stops that disproportionately affect people of color and are often used as pretexts to search for drugs and weapons. An NBC News analysis of the early data shows that the measure is having an impact on the percentage of Black motorists searched by police during traffic stops. \u201cAs public defenders, we aren\u2019t exactly used to winning, let alone winning big,\u201d said Brad Haywood, the chief public defender for Arlington County and executive director of Justice Forward, a criminal justice reform organization made up of public defenders across the state. \u201cThis will dramatically reduce race-based policing and impact so many lives.\u201d Long a cornerstone of American law enforcement, the traffic stop has emerged as a flashpoint in the debate over police reform. Over the last 20 months, district attorneys in California and Minnesota have ordered prosecutors to drop cases in which officers found guns or drugs during traffic stops for minor infractions. Other states, including Washington and Massachusetts, are considering restrictions similar to Virginia\u2019s. Proponents describe the measures as a long overdue step in banishing a tactic that targets mainly Black drivers and fails to improve public safety. But many law enforcement officials argue that they\u2019re being stripped of a crucial tool that they say helps to reduce vehicle deaths and remove criminals, guns and drugs from the streets, although the police chiefs and sheriffs interviewed for this article struggled to provide data backing up their case. Maggie DeBoard, the chief of the Herndon Police Department in Virginia, said stripping police of the ability to make certain traffic stops will make the roads more susceptible to traffic accidents and create fewer opportunities for officers to encounter people who should be off the streets. \u201cWe are eliminating more and more interactions with criminals by not allowing us to enforce the laws that are on the books,\u201d said DeBoard, who was the president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police as the group fought the bill. \u201cA lot of times you stop a vehicle, you have no idea the race, color, creed, religion of the person you're stopping,\u201d DeBoard said. \u201cYou see a violation, you stop the car. And at night, you definitely don\u2019t know who you\u2019re stopping. So it is not about targeting.\u201d Virginia started collecting detailed traffic stop statistics only in June 2020. The early data suggest that the law is having some effect on how the roads are policed. In the first four months after the law was enacted \u2014 March to June \u2014 the number of overall traffic stops rose by 7 percent compared to the previous four months, which experts said isn\u2019t surprising given that warmer weather tends to attract more drivers to the roads. But the number of motorists subjected to searches after having been pulled over \u2014 the category that the reformers care about most \u2014 dropped sharply, according to an NBC News analysis of police data obtained in a public records request. The number of Black drivers who were searched fell by 40 percent, and the number of white drivers dropped by 30 percent, the data show. Black people still accounted for about 30 percent of all traffic stops \u2014 the same percentage as before the law was changed \u2014 even though they are about 20 percent of the population of Virginia. White people, who make up 65 percent of the population, accounted for slightly under 65 percent of the stops before and after the law was changed, the early data show. Da\u2019Quan Marcell Love, the executive director of the Virginia NAACP, said the decline in the number of searches of Black drivers shows that the reforms are broadly working. But he said advocates are waiting to see how the situation plays out in the long term. \u201cWe have to give it time to work,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe are not launching a celebration any time soon.\u201d Officers stop about 20 million drivers a year, according to federal estimates, for reasons from speeding to blowing through reds light to expired tags. The vast majority of the encounters last only a few minutes and result in tickets or warnings, research shows. Police across the country have long been criticized for using minor infractions such as broken taillights as reasons to stop motorists and investigate them for possible crimes. Criminologists and civil rights lawyers have panned the tactic as a fishing expedition rife with racial bias that yields few results. Frank Baumgartner, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed more than 24 million traffic stops across North Carolina from 2002 to 2020. He found that the encounters led to arrests about 2 percent of the time. Searches also rarely occurred, and when they did, weapons were discovered in one-tenth of 1 percent of incidents. Black people were the subjects of nearly half the stops, Baumgartner found, even though they are only 21 percent of the state\u2019s population. \u201cFor every one bad guy they catch, they alienate, like, 18 young Black men,\u201d Baumgartner said. \u201cThat's where we get to the crisis of trust with the police.\u201d That type of traffic stop led to two of the highest-profile police killings in recent years: those of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Both were Black men who were shot and killed by officers after having been pulled over for broken taillights. Officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder of Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked coast-to-coast calls for reform. Faced with overwhelming public pressure, elected officials are increasingly moving forward with measures to strip away police powers regardless of whether law enforcement leaders support them. Last month, the top prosecutor in Ramsey County, Minnesota, where Castile was killed, announced that he would no longer prosecute  most cases that stem from non-public-safety traffic stops, such as expired tags. He cited the disproportionate impact on people of color, especially Black people, among other reasons. \u201cThe outcome of these stops is that it yields very, very little contraband,\u201d said the prosecutor, County Attorney John Choi. \u201cIf I thought that this would lead to more problems from a public safety perspective, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Larger police departments in Choi\u2019s county supported the move, but the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association described it as \u201cinsulting.\u201d More statewide bans may be on the horizon as politicians continue to openly shrug off opposition from police. Inspired by the change in Virginia\u2019s law, Joe Nguyen, a Democratic state senator in Washington, recently introduced legislation that would prohibit police from pulling motorists over for failing to stop, driving without licenses and other violations. \u201cWe passed a few bills last year that didn\u2019t have law enforcement support, so it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of,\u201d Nguyen said. Some police chiefs across the country, in places like Oakland, California; Minneapolis; and Portland, Oregon, have retooled their traffic enforcement policies to avoid unnecessary confrontations with drivers. The Oakland Police Department issued a directive five years ago discouraging officers from pulling people over for low-level offenses like equipment violations and expired registrations. Since the policies were put in place, the percentage of Black drivers who were stopped fell from 62 percent in 2016 to 51 percent in 2019. The police department enlisted Stanford University to examine its data, which showed that under 3 percent of stops in 2013 and 2014 were linked to more serious crimes. Deputy Police Chief Christopher Bolton urged Oakland police brass reluctant to reform to take a hard look at the statistics. \u201cWhy are we continuing to do those stops when the data is showing that not only is it not effective and efficient, but it could very well be damaging public trust and confidence in what our strategies are?\u201d Bolton asked. But in San Francisco, District Attorney Chesa Boudin\u2019s push to end \u201cpretextual\u201d traffic stops has met fierce resistance from the police. During his second month in office, Boudin told staff members to refrain from prosecuting people who were stopped for minor infractions and found to have \u201ccontraband,\u201d including drugs and guns. Union officials slammed Boudin for creating an environment in which criminals feel comfortable to break the law without fear of punishment. \u201cIf they want to continue to handcuff the police in doing their jobs, the unintended consequences are going to be more crime victims,\u201d said Tony Montoya, the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Union officials blame Boudin\u2019s new traffic policy for the release of a man who was accused of fatally shooting two people weeks after he was pulled over and found with an assault-style rifle without a serial number. The district attorney\u2019s office said its decision not to pursue charges against the suspect, Robert Newt, had nothing to do with the circumstances of the stop. The investigators didn\u2019t provide DNA or fingerprints that could tie Newt to the gun, Boudin\u2019s office said. Rachel Marshall, a spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office, said the policy \u201coffers room for exceptions.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office said it has rejected about one to two cases a month because of Boudin\u2019s rules, for a total of 11 this year. \u201cRacial profiling undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and fosters distrust in communities of color \u2014 all of which decreases public safety,\u201d Marshall said. Police chiefs and sheriffs in Virginia say that the state\u2019s ban went too far and that it is putting lives at risk at a time when murders and fatal accidents are already soaring. The original bill, in fact, would have gone even further by blocking police from stopping vehicles with no front lights. The governor\u2019s office cut the measure after Chesterfield County Police Chief Jeffrey Katz blasted it in a viral Facebook post. The new law permits a driver to have one broken headlight. \u201cLawmakers were making decisions based on the loudest voices in the room, but not necessarily the most informed voices in the room,\u201d Katz said in an interview. \u201cAnd all you have to do is look at the crime rate in the last year and a half.\u201d As in many other states, the number of murders in Virginia has risen sharply since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Virginia State Police. Even though officers can still cite people for speeding and erratic driving, rural county sheriffs said the ban creates an atmosphere in which reckless motorists feel safe to break the law, and they warned that traffic deaths will rise. Fatal traffic accidents in the six months after the law was changed hit a 10-year high, according to an NBC News analysis that compared them to the same period going back to 2011. Jessica Cowardin, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said the rise in traffic deaths mirrors national figures, which are also up. Federal officials blame the increase on speeding, drunk drivers and people who don\u2019t wear seat belts \u2014 violations that police in Virginia can still enforce. For some Virginia police chiefs, the concerns go beyond traffic accidents. In Petersburg, about 20 miles south of Richmond, officers confiscated more than 1,000 guns in the three years leading up to the ban, often in vehicle stops, Police Chief Travis Christian said. But his office was unable to provide data backing up the claim. The analysis of arrest data found that weapons were discovered in about 7 percent of traffic stops in Petersburg from 2018 to 2020. As a chief who is Black, Christian said he is \u201ctorn\u201d over the new law. He acknowledged that Black Virginians feel targeted by police when they are behind the wheel, but he said he still wants the ban reversed. \u201cIt has given us the ability to use it as an investigative tool to get to other crimes that have been committed,\u201d Christian said. \u201cThat tool has been eliminated for us.\u201d David Weisburd, a criminology professor and the executive director of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, said he wasn\u2019t aware of any data that support the claim that low-level traffic stops help to reduce crime. \u201cIt is time, in my view, for the police to bring evidence to their arguments,\u201d Weisburd said. \u201cThat evidence could help in deciding what is reasonable or unreasonable or what is good policing from what is awful policing.\u201d The new law hasn\u2019t put an end to controversial stops in Virginia. Five days after the ban went into effect, state troopers pulled over Juanisha Brooks, 35, a Black woman who is a senior video producer for the Defense Department, as she was driving along a highway in Northern Virginia. A trooper ordered her to get out of the vehicle several times, saying he wanted to show her what was wrong with her car. Brooks refused, saying she didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t tell her while she remained in the vehicle. Dashcam video appears to show the trooper dragging Brooks out of the seat and pushing her up against her car. Officers charged her with reckless driving, eluding, obstruction of justice and failing to have her headlights on. Prosecutors dropped the case, noting that the stop was illegal because of the reforms. Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, insisted that the arrest was fair because Brooks refused to comply with the trooper\u2019s commands. State Police conducted an internal investigation; Geller said she couldn\u2019t share whether the trooper was disciplined because of privacy rules. \u201cI was afraid for my life,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be another hashtag.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ems-services-warn-crippling-labor-shortage-undermining-911-system-rcna2677", "title": "EMS services warn of 'crippling labor shortage' undermining 911 system", "subtitle": "\u201cWe\u2019re not bleeding any longer \u2014 we\u2019re hemorrhaging,\u201d one ambulance service operator said of a decadelong worker shortage exacerbated by the pandemic.", "author": "By Phil McCausland", "section": null, "body": "The pandemic-induced shortage of emergency medical technicians and paramedics nationwide is so dire that ambulance service providers warn of sharp cuts to services and longer waits for 911 calls \u2014 even when it\u2019s a matter of life or death. Companies have had to close, consolidate or come up with new strategies to answer calls, said American Ambulance Association President Shawn Baird, who added that there is simply not enough EMS personnel to cover calls in many parts of the country, especially during the pandemic. The loss of staff to pandemic-related burnout and low wages has created a vicious cycle, requiring greater dependence on those workers who have stayed on. The situation has deteriorated to such a degree in recent months that ambulance services and industry leaders are pleading with Congress and state legislatures to help. \"The magnitude has really blown up over the last few months,\" Baird said. \"When you take a system that was already fragile and stretched it, because you didn't have enough people entering the field, then you throw a public health emergency and all of the additional burdens that it put on our workforce as well as the labor shortages across the entire economy, and it really has put us in a crisis mode.\" It's a crisis that has made it difficult to hire and even harder to retain EMTs and paramedics, according to a AAA survey of 258 EMS organizations across the country. In 2020, nearly a third of the workforce left their ambulance company after less than a year, the survey said. Eleven percent left within the first three months. \"It's almost unmanageable,\" said Ken Cummings, who leads Tri-Hospital EMS in Port Huron, Michigan. \"I don't think any EMS provider wants to go out in public and say that your service might be interrupted, but the reality is that because of the extremely low workforce situation right now, we are going to start to see delays. We're already seeing that throughout the country right now.\" Cummings said he currently has 10 openings, about 10 percent of his workforce. He's currently paying double overtime to fill the gap left by those empty positions, but that has increased the average work week of his paramedics by at least eight hours. The amount of money he's paying in overtime is also becoming untenable, and his workers are losing interest in the extra cash. \"We're spending money today that we're hoping we get tomorrow, to be real honest with you,\" he said. \"It's not a long-term solution.\" There are an estimated 1,000 open EMS positions in Michigan alone, Cummings said. The good news for Cummings is that he has a handful of students who will graduate next year from the paramedic program, but the churn is constant. The Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, also agreed to allocate $12.9 million of the state's budget to increase reimbursement rates. But that has not slowed the revolving-door nature of the job. Among full-time EMTs, 47 percent reported in 2020 that the reason for leaving was for a career or occupation change, according to the survey. That number is 45 percent among paramedics. \"In my experience running an EMS service, I've seen more than a few employees get into the industry and leave within six months,\" said Judd Smith, the program director of Texas EMS School in Abilene. \"I'll see people work for three weeks and then move on to the next thing.\" The decline in Texas has been particularly substantial. By mid-August, only 27 percent of licensed EMS professionals had submitted a patient care record, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, meaning that over 70 percent of licensed Texas EMTs did not work on an ambulance in the first eight months of the year. That represents a significant drop from the 43 percent of EMTs who submitted reports in 2020 and the 45 percent who did in 2019. The circumstances have pushed the American Ambulance Association and National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians to send a letter to Congress last week pushing for a hearing to address the shortfall and asking for more funding to increase wages. The letter warned that \"our nation\u2019s EMS system is facing a crippling workforce shortage, a long-term problem that has been building for more than a decade. It threatens to undermine our emergency 9-1-1 infrastructure and deserves urgent attention by the Congress.\" The pandemic has made a bad labor problem worse. The spread of the virus, the frequency of calls, worry of potential infection and the necessary safeguards that emergency personnel must take to protect themselves have created additional stress that has caused many to leave the field, providers said. Their departure has then increased the need for those who remain to work overtime, pushing even more to leave the field. The nationwide health emergency also caused many EMT and paramedic courses to shut down, meaning there is a dearth of students coming into the industry. \"We're not bleeding any longer \u2014 we're hemorrhaging,\" said Gary Wadaga, who operates Bay Ambulance in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Ambulance companies have faced years of workforce challenges that has damaged their ability to respond to calls quickly, but the situation is getting worse. Last year, because an ambulance service closed south of his company's service area, Wadaga had to take on an additional 100 square miles of territory. Now he covers 1,500 square miles and receives about 1,000 calls a year with six paramedic positions. The trouble is, he's been unable to fill two spots and has another two workers on leave, leaving him and one other person to respond to every emergency call that comes in. \"I've not seen it this bad in 41 years, and you can't just set that aside,\" said Wadaga, adding that the increasing demands of the job have caused him great anxiety. \"You want to be there for your community, but the fact that one day we're not going to have enough people absolutely bothers me.\" Ambulance companies once had the luxury of considering applicants, but that appears to be a concept of the past. Now companies are actively recruiting and even going after one another's employees because the pool of eligible workers is so small. \"Overall, it's robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Baird, \"because every community needs these folks.\" Wadaga and other ambulance service operators said the pandemic has increased the viciousness of a labor shortage and put the nation's emergency medical system at risk of a \"death spiral\" that could be difficult to pull out of. The salary requests of a shrinking workforce are getting higher as wages remain stagnant. The 2020 median pay for EMTs and paramedics was $36,650 per year or $17.62 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about a 7.5 percent increase since 2011. Advocates said the wages don't match the requirements of the job anymore. \"When you're an EMS provider putting your life on the line and entering into a closed environments with infectious patients and you can make more money to work in an Amazon warehouse, it becomes really difficult to retain people,\" said Robert Luckritz, who serves as chair of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians' EMS Workforce Committee. But it's not just retail and warehouse work that's calling. Luckritz said that hospitals facing their own nursing and health care worker shortages are at times actively recruiting EMT and paramedics, promising higher wages, better hours and increased benefits. That's an issue Luckritz and his colleagues are attempting to work on, but it's a challenge. They need more money to hire more people, but ambulance company rates are set by insurance providers and the government when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, which both contribute to the vast majority of calls, Luckritz said. \"Unlike much of the other industries across the country ... we're not able to raise our prices \u2014 our prices are set by the government,\" he said. \"So with reimbursement not keeping up with our costs, it makes it very difficult for us to compete for the workforce.\" The fear is that if the country doesn't face these problems now, they will be unfixable down the line. Baird, the AAA president, said that if things spiral too far down, \"we can\u2019t get people to even enter the field because it looks too daunting.\" \"We have to turn this around,\" he said. One silver lining is that online EMS programs, such as Smith's Texas EMS School, are seeing increased interest \u2014 even as nationwide there is a decline in enrollment in traditional programs. The number of applications for their EMT program, which can be completed in 10 to 18 weeks via a mix of online coursework and hands-on clinical and field experience, jumped from 495 applicants in 2019 to 1,469 in 2021. The jobs certainly are there waiting for them at graduation. \"I don't know of any one of our students that doesn't get hired within the first week of getting licensed,\" Smith said. \"We've even had a big number of them get hired before they even received their certification, so they start working as soon as they're done.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-stake-2022-hopes-child-cash-benefits-there-s-just-n1281142", "title": "Democrats stake 2022 hopes on child cash benefits.

But in doing so, they planted an election-year time bomb for their own party, and their only realistic hope of defusing it in time is to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s social spending bill. At the center of the American Rescue Plan is a monthly payment structured as a tax credit for the vast majority of families \u2014 of $300 per child under 6 years old or $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. The benefit has been well received in polls, and studies say it quickly lifted millions of U.S. kids out of poverty. But there\u2019s a catch: It is only authorized for 2021. The payments end in December unless extended. With Republicans opposed, the only realistic vehicle to extend them is Biden\u2019s multitrillion-dollar bill, which Democratic leaders are working feverishly to craft. Allowing the payments to expire would risk erasing the economic gains and leaving struggling parents who have come to rely on it in the lurch. Democratic operatives warn it could turn a significant political asset into a liability just months before an election in which Republicans are historically favored to make gains. \u201cLetting the extremely popular child care tax credit expire would be exactly the type of mistake we can\u2019t afford,\u201d Tyler Law, a Democratic consultant who worked for the party\u2019s House election arm during the 2018 blue wave, said. \u201cDemocrats need to deliver win after win after win to show voters we can govern and deserve to stay in power,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet for success, but there\u2019s certainly a recipe for disaster: failing to pass the Biden agenda.\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the child tax credit has had a major impact in alleviating poverty and held it up as an example that says Democrats, when in charge, can help Americans. \u201cThe idea of letting it expire, I think, would be horrific,\u201d he said. While Democrats battle over what provisions make it into the bill, they appear to agree unanimously that the money for kids should be extended \u2014 from centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., to progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. But the details are unclear. The House version of the bill extends the payments through 2025. That may be adjusted as lawmakers sort out how to cut down the plan's price tag to get the centrists on board. And the income threshold for who is eligible may be adjusted as Manchin has demanded additional means-testing for the various programs in the bill. \u201cThere's some differences of opinion about how to do it, and how long to fund it, etcetera. And it has to fit within the overall top line of the bill,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. \u201cBut every Dem really wants it to happen.\u201d Republicans are adamantly opposed to the program and say it should expire. \u201cThe federal government shouldn't be in the business of just handing out money because you have kids,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said. \u201cThat's ridiculous.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Democrats of \u201ctrying to build a permanent welfare class in the country,\u201d saying the child tax credit includes \u201cdistributing more borrowed money to people who don't have a need for it.\u201d Some Democrats are spoiling for that fight. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the party\u2019s House campaign arm, projected confidence that Democrats will pass the bill, extend the child cash payments and then run on them. \u201cWe're going to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact that the Republicans have opposed it at every step of the way will come back to haunt them. I believe that it's exactly that type of thing that is the anvil on which we will hammer them in 2022.\u201d Sean McElwee, a progressive pollster who has been cited by the White House, said his firm has found that voters who received the child cash payment approve of Biden's job performance by a wide margin of 66 percent to 32 percent, whereas voters who haven't gotten it split evenly with 49 percent approving and disapproving. The firm, Data for Progress, found that those who voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020 and who receive the child tax credit register 79 percent disapproval of Biden, whereas 92 percent of those who do not receive it disapprove of the president. \u201cEnding the child tax credit would risk washing away these key persuasion gains that will be necessary to win in 2022 and 2024,\u201d McElwee said. Overall, the child cash payments are supported by 59 percent of U.S. adults, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. That includes 75 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of Republicans. Some of the states with the highest average per-month cash payments are conservative states. Progressives cite the program as an example of how government can make Americans' lives better. \u201cWe already have powerful data showing us that this tax credit is reducing hunger in America. It's providing school shoes and backpacks for kids to be able to go back to school,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u201cWe need to protect this \u2014 not just because it expires in an election year. We need to protect it because this helps American families.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/squid-game-entertaining-world-there-s-different-feeling-south-korea-n1281119", "title": "'Squid Game' is entertaining the world.

Because everyone else is. The nine-episode horror series on Netflix has hit No. 1 in 90 of the streaming service\u2019s markets around the world, including South Korea, where it was made. \u201cI got to the point where I could not hold a conversation without watching the show,\u201d said Jung Dunn, a security analyst in Seoul, the South Korean capital. But the show also strikes a nerve because it unflinchingly addresses a problem that is particularly entrenched in South Korea: debt and the never-ending struggle to pay it off. The cast of \u201cSquid Game\u201d features some of South Korea\u2019s biggest stars, including Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist, Seong Gi-hun, a hopelessly indebted father who receives a business card from a stranger offering him a way out. Along with 455 other contestants \u2014 from all walks of life but all deeply in debt too \u2014 he agrees to compete for a cash prize of 45.6 billion won (about $38 million) by playing a series of traditional Korean children\u2019s games, only to discover that elimination from each round means death. \u201cThere\u2019s this dissonance between Korean pride that this Korean show is dominating Netflix all around the world, and the discomfort with what the show appears to expose about Korea,\u201d said CedarBough Saeji, an assistant professor of Korean and East Asian studies at Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea. \u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing.\u201d That South Korea also produced \u201cParasite,\u201d the 2020 Oscar winner for best picture that also focused on themes of inequality, has probably accentuated this discomfort, Saeji said. Still, \u201cSquid Game\u201d is wildly popular in its home country. The show was released on Sept. 17 just before Chuseok, a Korean holiday similar to Thanksgiving when families gather, the perfect time for binge-watching. The surge in network traffic led one internet service provider to sue Netflix to cover its costs. The fervor has also spilled over into real life. A street vendor in Seoul who provided the makers of \u201cSquid Game\u201d with dalgona, a brittle sugar candy at the center of one of the games, told Reuters that he had seen a boom in business. Thousands of curious South Koreans also tried the eight-digit phone number that appears on the business card, which the show\u2019s makers didn\u2019t realize would reach an actual person. The owner of the number, and even people with similar numbers, have been inundated with calls and messages at all hours. On Wednesday, Netflix said it was working with the show\u2019s local production company to address the issue, including editing scenes to remove the number. Park Sae-ha, a senior studying economics at Yonsei University in Seoul, said \u201cSquid Game\u201d was \u201cspell-binding because it was so explicit and blunt.\u201d \u201cAlthough I am young, I could easily relate to the hard reality of a very competitive society,\u201d she said. That intense competitiveness may be one reason South Korea has been so successful, with a period of rapid industrialization starting in the 1960s that turned it into the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. But as in many other countries, a university degree and a white-collar job don\u2019t guarantee the financial security they used to, Saeji said. With an average income of about $42,000 a year, many Koreans now find they have to borrow to keep up. Fueled by low interest rates, household debt in South Korea has grown significantly in recent years, and is now equal to the country\u2019s annual GDP. (In the U.S., by contrast, household debt is about 80 percent of GDP.) People may rack up debt because of credit card spending, unemployment or gambling losses, but a large chunk of it is tied to real estate. Housing prices have been rising fast, especially under President Moon Jae-in, and the average price of an apartment in Seoul is nearing $1 million. Lending curbs and efforts to cool the housing market have done little to rein in household borrowing. In addition to housing, some Koreans, especially young people, borrow money to invest in cryptocurrency. Many Koreans start out by borrowing from legitimate financial institutions like banks, said Koo Se-Woong, a commentator on Korean culture based in Germany. When that avenue is exhausted, they may move on to second-tier lenders that charge higher interest. In the worst-case scenarios, he said, borrowers turn to loan shark operations that can charge triple-digit interest rates, \u201cand then you are pushed into situations from which you really cannot get out.\u201d According to some estimates, there are 400,000 Koreans in debt to loan sharks. \u201cWhen you look at the characters in the show who are participating in this game, they represent that demographic of the Koreans who are in the worst possible situation because of their personal debt,\u201d Koo said. In a recent widely shared Facebook post, Koo said he was shocked when a friend told him he was living paycheck to paycheck, despite having a good job. The friend \u201cdoesn't strike anyone as extravagant,\u201d Koo said, but struggles to afford the trappings of middle-class life: an apartment, a car and occasional travel with his wife and children. \"It's all paid for by loans, I am telling you,\" Koo said his friend told him. \"We just have no money.\" Jung, the security analyst, said the plot of \u201cSquid Game\u201d was easy to accept because \u201cit dealt with such familiar stories of debt-ridden people you come across in real life.\u201d \u201cThe story stems from a deeply rooted perception of how society looks at failure, especially individual financial failure,\u201d he said. Bankruptcy in South Korea is generally seen not as a chance to start over but as a devastating fate. That is underlined in \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Saeji said, when contestants are given the option to leave but choose to keep playing even at the risk of their lives. \u201cIn the regular world it\u2019s not just the death of their body, it\u2019s the death of their pride. It\u2019s the shame of having to be such an unsuccessful person in front of your family,\u201d she said. Viewers in South Korea say the show is all the more disturbing because it injects death and violence into playground games like Red Light, Green Light and tug of war. The show plays on childhood nostalgia \u201cand along with it the innocent times when you had no problems,\u201d said Kim Hern-sik, a pop culture critic in Seoul. \u201cYet the story tells you that escaping from reality is not the answer.\u201d \u201cSquid Game\u201d is \u201cfundamentally a Korean story, featuring games people would remember playing as kids,\u201d Don Kang, vice president of Korean content at Netflix, told NBC News in an email. \u201cSo we knew it would resonate with our members here.\u201d Its popularity in the West came as more of a surprise. But Korean cultural exports have been sweeping Asia for years, and Netflix was already betting on their growing appeal. The company is spending $500 million this year on Korean content, almost as much as it spent in the last five years. Saeji said that after decades of Western cultural influence, the success of \u201cSquid Game\u201d shows that South Korea can make a TV show with a Hollywood feel \u201cand they can do it better.\u201d While \u201cSquid Game\u201d is not the first story about a fight to the death, director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who has a film degree from the University of Southern California, made it influential in his own way, said Oh Dong-jin, a prominent film critic in South Korea. \u201cEvery movie borrows this and that from other movies. What matters, therefore, is how creatively you can borrow from different references,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, even from this standpoint, the traditional children\u2019s games the show uses make 'Squid Game' quite original.\u201d Margie Kim, a housewife in Seoul who is watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d with her family, said that while she enjoyed its intensity and pop-art-influenced visuals, the underlying messages were also important. \u201cI do feel the pain of what our society is going through,\u201d she said. The show deals with so many pressing issues, she said\u2014income inequality, youth unemployment, a rapidly aging society\u2014that it\u2019s something her entire family can relate to and talk about. \u201cSo many middle-class, ordinary people live with so much debt,\u201d she said. \u201cI could totally empathize with people who joined the game.\u201d Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Stella Kim reported from Los Angeles.", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/working-companies-owned-well-heeled-private-equity-firms-can-mean-n1281146", "title": "Working for companies owned by well-heeled private-equity firms can mean lower wages for employees", "subtitle": "Workers at some fast-food chains owned by public firms are getting better wages now. It\u2019s a different story at restaurants owned by private-equity firms.", "author": "By Gretchen Morgenson", "section": null, "body": "Alma Jordan, a certified nursing assistant at the Marcella Center nursing home in Burlington, New Jersey, respected the residents she cared for there over the past 16 years. They were like family, she said, and she believes they\u2019ve appreciated her attentiveness, especially during Covid-19. Not so, the nursing home\u2019s new owner, Jordan said. After Complete Care Management, the largest for-profit nursing home operator in New Jersey, took over the 150-bed Marcella Center in April, it slashed worker benefits, she and other employees as well as a representative from their union told NBC News. Amid the pandemic, Jordan\u2019s paid holidays were reduced, and her monthly health insurance costs more than tripled, she said. The company stopped contributing to the employee pension, replacing it with a 401(k) plan that had no employer match or contribution. Complete Care took away vision insurance and stopped a reimbursement program covering employee education costs, so Jordan, 45, won\u2019t be able to recoup money she spent working toward a degree to become a licensed practical nurse. \u201cI put all my effort into this company, and someone else took over and they don\u2019t want to give us what we deserve,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s business. It\u2019s not about the staff and the residents. It\u2019s only about making profits.\u201d In late September, Jordan quit her position at the facility. The reduced benefits and deteriorating work conditions got to be too much, she said. When Complete Care came in, Jordan and other Marcella workers were operating under a union contract struck with the facility\u2019s previous owner. Complete Care did away with that contract, which also covered four other unionized New Jersey nursing facilities it recently acquired, according to the Service Employees International Union. Complete Care owns 61 facilities in eight states, including Connecticut, Maryland and Wisconsin. It is backed by a private-equity firm called Peace Capital in Lakewood, New Jersey, whose principal owner is Sam Stein. Jordan and her fellow workers are not alone in experiencing reduced circumstances after their company is taken over by a private-equity firm. The new titans of finance, these firms use large pools of debt \u2014 typically raised in what's called the leveraged loan market \u2014 to acquire companies they hope to resell in a few years at a profit. Among companies raising money in this loan market during the past three years, debt levels at private-equity-backed entities were at least 30 percent higher than debt levels at companies not backed by private equity, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. But the heavy debt loads they take on, combined with pressure to flip acquired companies quickly, increases the likelihood that private-equity firms will have to cut costs in the operations that they buy. Often, the first to the chopping block is the company\u2019s workforce. A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research lays this out. Researchers analyzed almost 10,000 debt-fueled buyouts between 1980 and 2013 and found that employment fell by 13 percent when a private-equity firm took over a public company. Employment declined by even more \u2014 16 percent \u2014 when private equity acquired a unit or division of a company. Eileen Appelbaum is an economist and co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, and co-author of \"Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street.\" Her study of private equity has led her to conclude that the industry\u2019s growing clout is not only a concern for workers, but also has the potential to harm the nation\u2019s broader economy. \u201cYou have a lot more ownership of productive resources by investors who don\u2019t know an industry, don\u2019t understand the value of skilled workers and who are just in it to make their profit and get out,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cThat erodes productivity.\u201d Almost 12 million employees, or roughly 7 percent of the U.S. labor force, work for private-equity-backed businesses, according to the American Investment Council, an industry lobbying group. These companies generated about 6.5 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product last year, the group said. The council said private-equity firms create jobs, support businesses and help provide comfortable retirements for pensioners invested in the strategy. A spokeswoman for Complete Care echoed this view. She said the company is committed to the long-term viability of its facilities, adding in a statement: \u201cWe offer a comprehensive health plan and competitive benefits, and our facilities are known as great places to work.\u201d The company is negotiating a new union contract, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, though, care at the Marcella facility is declining, Jordan said, days after she quit. \u201cWe were very short-staffed,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think the residents pick up on that because it takes longer to answer a call.\u201d In a statement, a spokesperson for Complete Care said, \u201cComplete Care at Marcella consistently maintains state mandated ratios. ... We take whatever measures necessary to ensure that we have proper staffing to meet the needs of those in our care, including bringing in agency staff and offering bonuses as needed.\" Private equity is a sophisticated investment strategy that has grown furiously in recent years. At the end of last year, assets under management at the firms worldwide stood at $5 trillion, up from $1.5 trillion over the past decade, according to Preqin, a financial data provider. The number of funds devoted to these activities has more than doubled during that period, and last year, private-equity firms paid some $600 billion to acquire companies, up from $250 billion 10 years earlier. Private-equity firms began their climb to power in the 1980s; then they were known as leveraged buyout shops, because of the debt they use. The $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988 by private-equity giant Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts brought such deals to center stage. In recent years, as prevailing interest rates collapsed, private-equity operations have been able to take on greater amounts of low-cost debt to make their acquisitions. Through Sept. 27, for example, $472 billion of leveraged loans were issued, up from $237 billion issued during the same period in 2019, according to LCD of S&P Global. Outside investors, such as public pension funds and endowments, pour money into these takeover deals in the hopes of generating high returns. But recently, as the stock market has roared, outsize returns in private equity have all but vanished, academic studies show, and they are now in line with overall market performance. Nevertheless, more companies are owned by private-equity firms now than trade on the nation\u2019s stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, private-equity firms\u2019 rising dominance has generated immense wealth for their executives. The value of Sam Stein's holdings in Complete Care could not be determined and the company declined to provide it, but it is almost certainly dwarfed by those of Stephen Schwarzman, head of Blackstone Group. A close adviser to Donald Trump during his presidency, Schwarzman is worth $35 billion, according to Forbes magazine, up from $15 billion in 2020. Private equity also benefited from recent government interventions related to the Covid pandemic, documents show. At least $5 billion in federal bailout money went to companies backed by large and well-capitalized private-equity firms, according to a recent report from Americans for Financial Reform. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board launched an unprecedented $750 billion program to prop up the corporate bond market, where many of these firms raise money for their buyouts. Among the bonds purchased by the Fed, documents show, were those issued by Blackstone and another private-equity giant, Apollo Global Management, founded by Leon Black. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently testified that the agency would increase its scrutiny on fee disclosures and conflicts of interest among private funds, to ensure their practices don't put investors in these strategies at a disadvantage. And Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a late September memo outlining the agency's priorities that \"the growing role of private equity\" invites an examination of how these firms' business models \"may facilitate unfair methods of competition and consumer protection violations.\" Finally, the Democrats\u2019 proposed tax increase on capital gains may crimp private-equity executives\u2019 earnings. A key reason many of these executives have been able to amass such fortunes is that so much of their earnings are taxed as capital gains with a top rate of 20 percent, not at the higher 37 percent rate that can apply to income. This is a benefit they've tapped for decades, often allowing them to pay a lower tax rate on earnings than a secretary or a teacher might. One of the nation\u2019s biggest private-equity employers is Roark Capital of Atlanta. It owns Inspire Brands \u2014 parent company to an array of fast-food chains that includes Arby\u2019s, Dunkin\u2019, Baskin-Robbins and Sonic \u2014 and other brands such as Cinnabon and Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee. NBC News estimates that more than 700,000 people work at Inspire Brands, many at independently owned franchise stores. Roark is named for the libertarian protagonist in \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d by Ayn Rand, whose life \u201cexemplified the qualities of independence and integrity,\u201d the company\u2019s website said. One of libertarianism's basic tenets is limited government, but three dozen companies owned by Roark obtained $183 million in federal assistance under the CARES Act, according to the Americans for Financial Reform report. Asked whether this acceptance of government funding ran counter to a limited government stance, Roark declined to comment through a spokeswoman. Zella Roberts, a recent graduate of Warren Wilson College near Asheville, North Carolina, worked as a carhop at a Sonic Drive-In earlier this year to help pay tuition. Her all-in pay plummeted during the pandemic, Roberts told NBC News, because customers\u2019 cash usage fell and Sonic did not allow tips on credit cards. Roberts said she and some colleagues sent an email to Roark Capital \"explaining the conditions that Sonic workers experience. The big ask was to put pressure on Sonic corporate to make these changes.\" She said she never heard back about that or other messages sent to Neal Aronson, managing partner and founder of Roark Capital. Aronson is the controlling owner of Roark, regulatory filings show, which has $18.6 billion in assets under management. Through a spokeswoman, Aronson declined to comment. In January, after Roberts had collected 7,800 signatures on a petition asking Roark to change its policy, the company allowed tips on credit card orders placed through its app. An improvement, Roberts acknowledged, but such orders are a small percentage of those made via credit cards, she pointed out. The Inspire Brands spokesman said barring tips on credit cards \u201cis a technology limitation that we inherited when we purchased the brand\u201d in 2018. \u201cWe are now working on implementing the credit card tipping capability,\u201d he said. Inspire Brands has also worked to battle the Raise the Wage Act, which has been introduced in Congress every year since 2017 and would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour among workers like Roberts. In March, Inspire sent a memo to franchise owners highlighting its lobbying success in opposing the change. Describing its efforts, Inspire said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you\u2019re on the menu, and you can guarantee your opponents are eating!\u201d Chris Fuller, a spokesman for Inspire Brands, said the company fought the national minimum wage legislation because \u201cwe don\u2019t support a one-size-fits-all approach to the minimum wage. We believe in letting the local markets dictate.\u201d He added: \u201cMore than 90 percent of our team members at corporate-owned restaurants are above the state or local minimum wage.\u201d Some Inspire Brands workers have taken matters into their own hands. This summer, Matthew Honeycutt, 18, was working at an Arby\u2019s in Charlotte, North Carolina, making $9.50 an hour as a shift manager. He supports an 8-month-old son. On July 20, he and a group of workers walked off the job seeking a pay raise, forcing managers to close the Arby\u2019s store two hours early, Honeycutt said. That got management\u2019s attention, he said. \u201cThe strike was on a Tuesday, and it was about Thursday when he started getting the raises out,\u201d Honeycutt said of his boss, who gave him a 50-cents-an-hour raise. \"Every kind of worker you can think of is working so hard, but they're not getting paid what they\u2019re worth.\" Honeycutt\u2019s boss did not respond to a voicemail message seeking comment. In mid-September, Honeycutt quit his job at Arby's for a higher-paying position elsewhere. While Inspire Brands fights against a higher minimum wage, some other restaurant companies owned by publicly traded companies are taking a different approach. They say increasing worker pay is good for business. In February, Robert Verostek, the chief financial officer of restaurant chain Denny\u2019s, told investors that paying a higher wage to its workers in California had resulted in \u201cnot just positive sales, but positive guest traffic.\u201d And in May, McDonald's began increasing pay by 10 percent for almost 37,000 workers in company-owned stores. Shift managers like Honeycutt, who earned $10 at Arby\u2019s, are earning between $15 and $20 an hour depending on the location, McDonald\u2019s said. Sean Dunlop, an equity analyst at Morningstar Research, said Inspire Brands is a well-managed company. But increasing pay and benefits among workers is an industry trend it won't be able to resist. \"As you\u2019re thinking about bigger chains, not only are they making a broader push to a $15 average wage at restaurants, you\u2019ve also seen them offer tuition assistance, paid time off, retention bonuses and referral bonuses as they\u2019ve been trying to attract workers,\" Dunlop said. \"Inspire Brands, if they want to compete, are going to be forced to raise wages. They're going to have to, whether they want to or not.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/silicon-valley-area-food-banks-strain-under-growing-logistical-needs-n1281047", "title": "Silicon Valley area food banks strain under growing logistical needs of poverty", "subtitle": "\u201cInfrastructure requirements have sorely taxed the charitable food system at a time when demand is still extraordinarily high,\u201d one expert said.", "author": "By Cyrus Farivar", "section": null, "body": "RICHMOND, Calif. \u2014 On a recent unseasonably warm October day, dozens of Californians gathered at a food distribution site on a vast, unshaded blacktop space behind an elementary school. In one hour, 193 people waited patiently to fill their carts and shopping bags with produce like bell peppers, apples, onions and squash from the side of a massive truck. \u201cThat\u2019s a record for this year,\u201d said Matthew Durkin, 30, the mobile distribution supervisor, while nodding at the clients and noting that he usually sees only about 160 people. \u201cIt means there\u2019s an increased need.\u201d Durkin, of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, says that while demand for free food has slowed slightly from the start of the pandemic, people are still hungry. \u201cWe have seen another jump in numbers within the last few months. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, adding that many clients have told them how much they fear returning to work. \"They are concerned about Covid-19 surges, as so many of us are, and some of them may need to stay available for unexpected changes in child care and school due to Covid exposures or cases.\u201d More than 18 months into the pandemic, San Francisco Bay Area nonprofit organizations, from food banks to shelters for domestic violence victims, say that they are seeing more demand for their services than they ever saw before the pandemic. Even now, there are still two members of the California National Guard working at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties\u2019 central warehouse in Fairfield. As the pandemic drags on, these support facilities are also struggling with supply chain problems to meet the seemingly endless demand. It presents even more challenges as supplies and workers grow more scarce. Joel Sjostrom, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, has watched the food bank\u2019s demand grow to 300,000 people at the height of the pandemic from 178,000 before the pandemic began. He is now still trying to find support for 240,000 clients each month. Almost immediately after the March 2020 shelter-in-place order was instituted, he said, his organization lost 35 percent of its volunteer workforce because it depends so heavily on older volunteers who were scared to work before they were vaccinated. He had to call in members of the California National Guard, two of which remain. \u201cTo meet those volume increases, we have had to step up facilities and transportation,\u201d Sjostrom added. \u201cI had heard of the National Guard being helpful to others in Southern California.\u201d At one point, there were as many as 25 soldiers working to help this one bank. In California, the National Guard, as of Thursday, still had 140 soldiers deployed to food banks across 16 counties, down from a high of 767 in April 2020, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan M. Shiroma, a California National Guard spokesperson. But the National Guard is gradually trying to cut those numbers back and deploy these workers to other missions. In addition to help from the National Guard, Sjostrom has hired more full-time staff. But even now, even with 16 drivers, he still would like four more \u201cClass A\u201d drivers who can operate big rig trucks. In order to stay competitive with other outfits that employ drivers, he said he has had to raise his rates from $28 per hour to $30 per hour. \u201cIt\u2019s truly market pressure,\u201d Sjostrom said. \u201cAmazon has ads out, as does Hello Fresh, and driver demand is everywhere.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/traffic-stops-are-flashpoint-policing-america-reformers-are-winning-big-n1280594", "title": "Police face a 'crisis of trust' with Black motorists.

Police chiefs aren't happy.", "author": "By Simone Weichselbaum, Emily R. Siegel and Andrew Blankstein", "section": null, "body": "In the months after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, public defenders in Virginia saw an opportunity to overhaul policing in the state. Among their key priorities to address racial disparities: a ban on traffic stops for such infractions as broken taillights, tinted windows and the aroma of marijuana. What happened next stunned police officials across Virginia. In just three months, the ban the public defenders pitched to Democratic legislators sailed to the governor\u2019s desk and was signed into law. With Covid-19 shutting down the state Capitol and forcing the legislative sessions to take place via Zoom, the law enforcement officials who objected to the bill had failed to galvanize the opposition. In March, Virginia became the first state to prohibit the kind of low-level traffic stops that disproportionately affect people of color and are often used as pretexts to search for drugs and weapons. An NBC News analysis of the early data shows that the measure is having an impact on the percentage of Black motorists searched by police during traffic stops. \u201cAs public defenders, we aren\u2019t exactly used to winning, let alone winning big,\u201d said Brad Haywood, the chief public defender for Arlington County and executive director of Justice Forward, a criminal justice reform organization made up of public defenders across the state. \u201cThis will dramatically reduce race-based policing and impact so many lives.\u201d Long a cornerstone of American law enforcement, the traffic stop has emerged as a flashpoint in the debate over police reform. Over the last 20 months, district attorneys in California and Minnesota have ordered prosecutors to drop cases in which officers found guns or drugs during traffic stops for minor infractions. Other states, including Washington and Massachusetts, are considering restrictions similar to Virginia\u2019s. Proponents describe the measures as a long overdue step in banishing a tactic that targets mainly Black drivers and fails to improve public safety. But many law enforcement officials argue that they\u2019re being stripped of a crucial tool that they say helps to reduce vehicle deaths and remove criminals, guns and drugs from the streets, although the police chiefs and sheriffs interviewed for this article struggled to provide data backing up their case. Maggie DeBoard, the chief of the Herndon Police Department in Virginia, said stripping police of the ability to make certain traffic stops will make the roads more susceptible to traffic accidents and create fewer opportunities for officers to encounter people who should be off the streets. \u201cWe are eliminating more and more interactions with criminals by not allowing us to enforce the laws that are on the books,\u201d said DeBoard, who was the president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police as the group fought the bill. \u201cA lot of times you stop a vehicle, you have no idea the race, color, creed, religion of the person you're stopping,\u201d DeBoard said. \u201cYou see a violation, you stop the car. And at night, you definitely don\u2019t know who you\u2019re stopping. So it is not about targeting.\u201d Virginia started collecting detailed traffic stop statistics only in June 2020. The early data suggest that the law is having some effect on how the roads are policed. In the first four months after the law was enacted \u2014 March to June \u2014 the number of overall traffic stops rose by 7 percent compared to the previous four months, which experts said isn\u2019t surprising given that warmer weather tends to attract more drivers to the roads. But the number of motorists subjected to searches after having been pulled over \u2014 the category that the reformers care about most \u2014 dropped sharply, according to an NBC News analysis of police data obtained in a public records request. The number of Black drivers who were searched fell by 40 percent, and the number of white drivers dropped by 30 percent, the data show. Black people still accounted for about 30 percent of all traffic stops \u2014 the same percentage as before the law was changed \u2014 even though they are about 20 percent of the population of Virginia. White people, who make up 65 percent of the population, accounted for slightly under 65 percent of the stops before and after the law was changed, the early data show. Da\u2019Quan Marcell Love, the executive director of the Virginia NAACP, said the decline in the number of searches of Black drivers shows that the reforms are broadly working. But he said advocates are waiting to see how the situation plays out in the long term. \u201cWe have to give it time to work,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe are not launching a celebration any time soon.\u201d Officers stop about 20 million drivers a year, according to federal estimates, for reasons from speeding to blowing through reds light to expired tags. The vast majority of the encounters last only a few minutes and result in tickets or warnings, research shows. Police across the country have long been criticized for using minor infractions such as broken taillights as reasons to stop motorists and investigate them for possible crimes. Criminologists and civil rights lawyers have panned the tactic as a fishing expedition rife with racial bias that yields few results. Frank Baumgartner, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed more than 24 million traffic stops across North Carolina from 2002 to 2020. He found that the encounters led to arrests about 2 percent of the time. Searches also rarely occurred, and when they did, weapons were discovered in one-tenth of 1 percent of incidents. Black people were the subjects of nearly half the stops, Baumgartner found, even though they are only 21 percent of the state\u2019s population. \u201cFor every one bad guy they catch, they alienate, like, 18 young Black men,\u201d Baumgartner said. \u201cThat's where we get to the crisis of trust with the police.\u201d That type of traffic stop led to two of the highest-profile police killings in recent years: those of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Both were Black men who were shot and killed by officers after having been pulled over for broken taillights. Officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder of Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked coast-to-coast calls for reform. Faced with overwhelming public pressure, elected officials are increasingly moving forward with measures to strip away police powers regardless of whether law enforcement leaders support them. Last month, the top prosecutor in Ramsey County, Minnesota, where Castile was killed, announced that he would no longer prosecute  most cases that stem from non-public-safety traffic stops, such as expired tags. He cited the disproportionate impact on people of color, especially Black people, among other reasons. \u201cThe outcome of these stops is that it yields very, very little contraband,\u201d said the prosecutor, County Attorney John Choi. \u201cIf I thought that this would lead to more problems from a public safety perspective, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Larger police departments in Choi\u2019s county supported the move, but the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association described it as \u201cinsulting.\u201d More statewide bans may be on the horizon as politicians continue to openly shrug off opposition from police. Inspired by the change in Virginia\u2019s law, Joe Nguyen, a Democratic state senator in Washington, recently introduced legislation that would prohibit police from pulling motorists over for failing to stop, driving without licenses and other violations. \u201cWe passed a few bills last year that didn\u2019t have law enforcement support, so it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of,\u201d Nguyen said. Some police chiefs across the country, in places like Oakland, California; Minneapolis; and Portland, Oregon, have retooled their traffic enforcement policies to avoid unnecessary confrontations with drivers. The Oakland Police Department issued a directive five years ago discouraging officers from pulling people over for low-level offenses like equipment violations and expired registrations. Since the policies were put in place, the percentage of Black drivers who were stopped fell from 62 percent in 2016 to 51 percent in 2019. The police department enlisted Stanford University to examine its data, which showed that under 3 percent of stops in 2013 and 2014 were linked to more serious crimes. Deputy Police Chief Christopher Bolton urged Oakland police brass reluctant to reform to take a hard look at the statistics. \u201cWhy are we continuing to do those stops when the data is showing that not only is it not effective and efficient, but it could very well be damaging public trust and confidence in what our strategies are?\u201d Bolton asked. But in San Francisco, District Attorney Chesa Boudin\u2019s push to end \u201cpretextual\u201d traffic stops has met fierce resistance from the police. During his second month in office, Boudin told staff members to refrain from prosecuting people who were stopped for minor infractions and found to have \u201ccontraband,\u201d including drugs and guns. Union officials slammed Boudin for creating an environment in which criminals feel comfortable to break the law without fear of punishment. \u201cIf they want to continue to handcuff the police in doing their jobs, the unintended consequences are going to be more crime victims,\u201d said Tony Montoya, the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Union officials blame Boudin\u2019s new traffic policy for the release of a man who was accused of fatally shooting two people weeks after he was pulled over and found with an assault-style rifle without a serial number. The district attorney\u2019s office said its decision not to pursue charges against the suspect, Robert Newt, had nothing to do with the circumstances of the stop. The investigators didn\u2019t provide DNA or fingerprints that could tie Newt to the gun, Boudin\u2019s office said. Rachel Marshall, a spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office, said the policy \u201coffers room for exceptions.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office said it has rejected about one to two cases a month because of Boudin\u2019s rules, for a total of 11 this year. \u201cRacial profiling undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and fosters distrust in communities of color \u2014 all of which decreases public safety,\u201d Marshall said. Police chiefs and sheriffs in Virginia say that the state\u2019s ban went too far and that it is putting lives at risk at a time when murders and fatal accidents are already soaring. The original bill, in fact, would have gone even further by blocking police from stopping vehicles with no front lights. The governor\u2019s office cut the measure after Chesterfield County Police Chief Jeffrey Katz blasted it in a viral Facebook post. The new law permits a driver to have one broken headlight. \u201cLawmakers were making decisions based on the loudest voices in the room, but not necessarily the most informed voices in the room,\u201d Katz said in an interview. \u201cAnd all you have to do is look at the crime rate in the last year and a half.\u201d As in many other states, the number of murders in Virginia has risen sharply since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Virginia State Police. Even though officers can still cite people for speeding and erratic driving, rural county sheriffs said the ban creates an atmosphere in which reckless motorists feel safe to break the law, and they warned that traffic deaths will rise. Fatal traffic accidents in the six months after the law was changed hit a 10-year high, according to an NBC News analysis that compared them to the same period going back to 2011. Jessica Cowardin, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said the rise in traffic deaths mirrors national figures, which are also up. Federal officials blame the increase on speeding, drunk drivers and people who don\u2019t wear seat belts \u2014 violations that police in Virginia can still enforce. For some Virginia police chiefs, the concerns go beyond traffic accidents. In Petersburg, about 20 miles south of Richmond, officers confiscated more than 1,000 guns in the three years leading up to the ban, often in vehicle stops, Police Chief Travis Christian said. But his office was unable to provide data backing up the claim. The analysis of arrest data found that weapons were discovered in about 7 percent of traffic stops in Petersburg from 2018 to 2020. As a chief who is Black, Christian said he is \u201ctorn\u201d over the new law. He acknowledged that Black Virginians feel targeted by police when they are behind the wheel, but he said he still wants the ban reversed. \u201cIt has given us the ability to use it as an investigative tool to get to other crimes that have been committed,\u201d Christian said. \u201cThat tool has been eliminated for us.\u201d David Weisburd, a criminology professor and the executive director of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, said he wasn\u2019t aware of any data that support the claim that low-level traffic stops help to reduce crime. \u201cIt is time, in my view, for the police to bring evidence to their arguments,\u201d Weisburd said. \u201cThat evidence could help in deciding what is reasonable or unreasonable or what is good policing from what is awful policing.\u201d The new law hasn\u2019t put an end to controversial stops in Virginia. Five days after the ban went into effect, state troopers pulled over Juanisha Brooks, 35, a Black woman who is a senior video producer for the Defense Department, as she was driving along a highway in Northern Virginia. A trooper ordered her to get out of the vehicle several times, saying he wanted to show her what was wrong with her car. Brooks refused, saying she didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t tell her while she remained in the vehicle. Dashcam video appears to show the trooper dragging Brooks out of the seat and pushing her up against her car. Officers charged her with reckless driving, eluding, obstruction of justice and failing to have her headlights on. Prosecutors dropped the case, noting that the stop was illegal because of the reforms. Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, insisted that the arrest was fair because Brooks refused to comply with the trooper\u2019s commands. State Police conducted an internal investigation; Geller said she couldn\u2019t share whether the trooper was disciplined because of privacy rules. \u201cI was afraid for my life,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be another hashtag.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ems-services-warn-crippling-labor-shortage-undermining-911-system-rcna2677", "title": "EMS services warn of 'crippling labor shortage' undermining 911 system", "subtitle": "\u201cWe\u2019re not bleeding any longer \u2014 we\u2019re hemorrhaging,\u201d one ambulance service operator said of a decadelong worker shortage exacerbated by the pandemic.", "author": "By Phil McCausland", "section": null, "body": "The pandemic-induced shortage of emergency medical technicians and paramedics nationwide is so dire that ambulance service providers warn of sharp cuts to services and longer waits for 911 calls \u2014 even when it\u2019s a matter of life or death. Companies have had to close, consolidate or come up with new strategies to answer calls, said American Ambulance Association President Shawn Baird, who added that there is simply not enough EMS personnel to cover calls in many parts of the country, especially during the pandemic. The loss of staff to pandemic-related burnout and low wages has created a vicious cycle, requiring greater dependence on those workers who have stayed on. The situation has deteriorated to such a degree in recent months that ambulance services and industry leaders are pleading with Congress and state legislatures to help. \"The magnitude has really blown up over the last few months,\" Baird said. \"When you take a system that was already fragile and stretched it, because you didn't have enough people entering the field, then you throw a public health emergency and all of the additional burdens that it put on our workforce as well as the labor shortages across the entire economy, and it really has put us in a crisis mode.\" It's a crisis that has made it difficult to hire and even harder to retain EMTs and paramedics, according to a AAA survey of 258 EMS organizations across the country. In 2020, nearly a third of the workforce left their ambulance company after less than a year, the survey said. Eleven percent left within the first three months. \"It's almost unmanageable,\" said Ken Cummings, who leads Tri-Hospital EMS in Port Huron, Michigan. \"I don't think any EMS provider wants to go out in public and say that your service might be interrupted, but the reality is that because of the extremely low workforce situation right now, we are going to start to see delays. We're already seeing that throughout the country right now.\" Cummings said he currently has 10 openings, about 10 percent of his workforce. He's currently paying double overtime to fill the gap left by those empty positions, but that has increased the average work week of his paramedics by at least eight hours. The amount of money he's paying in overtime is also becoming untenable, and his workers are losing interest in the extra cash. \"We're spending money today that we're hoping we get tomorrow, to be real honest with you,\" he said. \"It's not a long-term solution.\" There are an estimated 1,000 open EMS positions in Michigan alone, Cummings said. The good news for Cummings is that he has a handful of students who will graduate next year from the paramedic program, but the churn is constant. The Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, also agreed to allocate $12.9 million of the state's budget to increase reimbursement rates. But that has not slowed the revolving-door nature of the job. Among full-time EMTs, 47 percent reported in 2020 that the reason for leaving was for a career or occupation change, according to the survey. That number is 45 percent among paramedics. \"In my experience running an EMS service, I've seen more than a few employees get into the industry and leave within six months,\" said Judd Smith, the program director of Texas EMS School in Abilene. \"I'll see people work for three weeks and then move on to the next thing.\" The decline in Texas has been particularly substantial. By mid-August, only 27 percent of licensed EMS professionals had submitted a patient care record, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, meaning that over 70 percent of licensed Texas EMTs did not work on an ambulance in the first eight months of the year. That represents a significant drop from the 43 percent of EMTs who submitted reports in 2020 and the 45 percent who did in 2019. The circumstances have pushed the American Ambulance Association and National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians to send a letter to Congress last week pushing for a hearing to address the shortfall and asking for more funding to increase wages. The letter warned that \"our nation\u2019s EMS system is facing a crippling workforce shortage, a long-term problem that has been building for more than a decade. It threatens to undermine our emergency 9-1-1 infrastructure and deserves urgent attention by the Congress.\" The pandemic has made a bad labor problem worse. The spread of the virus, the frequency of calls, worry of potential infection and the necessary safeguards that emergency personnel must take to protect themselves have created additional stress that has caused many to leave the field, providers said. Their departure has then increased the need for those who remain to work overtime, pushing even more to leave the field. The nationwide health emergency also caused many EMT and paramedic courses to shut down, meaning there is a dearth of students coming into the industry. \"We're not bleeding any longer \u2014 we're hemorrhaging,\" said Gary Wadaga, who operates Bay Ambulance in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Ambulance companies have faced years of workforce challenges that has damaged their ability to respond to calls quickly, but the situation is getting worse. Last year, because an ambulance service closed south of his company's service area, Wadaga had to take on an additional 100 square miles of territory. Now he covers 1,500 square miles and receives about 1,000 calls a year with six paramedic positions. The trouble is, he's been unable to fill two spots and has another two workers on leave, leaving him and one other person to respond to every emergency call that comes in. \"I've not seen it this bad in 41 years, and you can't just set that aside,\" said Wadaga, adding that the increasing demands of the job have caused him great anxiety. \"You want to be there for your community, but the fact that one day we're not going to have enough people absolutely bothers me.\" Ambulance companies once had the luxury of considering applicants, but that appears to be a concept of the past. Now companies are actively recruiting and even going after one another's employees because the pool of eligible workers is so small. \"Overall, it's robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Baird, \"because every community needs these folks.\" Wadaga and other ambulance service operators said the pandemic has increased the viciousness of a labor shortage and put the nation's emergency medical system at risk of a \"death spiral\" that could be difficult to pull out of. The salary requests of a shrinking workforce are getting higher as wages remain stagnant. The 2020 median pay for EMTs and paramedics was $36,650 per year or $17.62 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about a 7.5 percent increase since 2011. Advocates said the wages don't match the requirements of the job anymore. \"When you're an EMS provider putting your life on the line and entering into a closed environments with infectious patients and you can make more money to work in an Amazon warehouse, it becomes really difficult to retain people,\" said Robert Luckritz, who serves as chair of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians' EMS Workforce Committee. But it's not just retail and warehouse work that's calling. Luckritz said that hospitals facing their own nursing and health care worker shortages are at times actively recruiting EMT and paramedics, promising higher wages, better hours and increased benefits. That's an issue Luckritz and his colleagues are attempting to work on, but it's a challenge. They need more money to hire more people, but ambulance company rates are set by insurance providers and the government when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, which both contribute to the vast majority of calls, Luckritz said. \"Unlike much of the other industries across the country ... we're not able to raise our prices \u2014 our prices are set by the government,\" he said. \"So with reimbursement not keeping up with our costs, it makes it very difficult for us to compete for the workforce.\" The fear is that if the country doesn't face these problems now, they will be unfixable down the line. Baird, the AAA president, said that if things spiral too far down, \"we can\u2019t get people to even enter the field because it looks too daunting.\" \"We have to turn this around,\" he said. One silver lining is that online EMS programs, such as Smith's Texas EMS School, are seeing increased interest \u2014 even as nationwide there is a decline in enrollment in traditional programs. The number of applications for their EMT program, which can be completed in 10 to 18 weeks via a mix of online coursework and hands-on clinical and field experience, jumped from 495 applicants in 2019 to 1,469 in 2021. The jobs certainly are there waiting for them at graduation. \"I don't know of any one of our students that doesn't get hired within the first week of getting licensed,\" Smith said. \"We've even had a big number of them get hired before they even received their certification, so they start working as soon as they're done.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-stake-2022-hopes-child-cash-benefits-there-s-just-n1281142", "title": "Democrats stake 2022 hopes on child cash benefits.

But in doing so, they planted an election-year time bomb for their own party, and their only realistic hope of defusing it in time is to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s social spending bill. At the center of the American Rescue Plan is a monthly payment structured as a tax credit for the vast majority of families \u2014 of $300 per child under 6 years old or $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. The benefit has been well received in polls, and studies say it quickly lifted millions of U.S. kids out of poverty. But there\u2019s a catch: It is only authorized for 2021. The payments end in December unless extended. With Republicans opposed, the only realistic vehicle to extend them is Biden\u2019s multitrillion-dollar bill, which Democratic leaders are working feverishly to craft. Allowing the payments to expire would risk erasing the economic gains and leaving struggling parents who have come to rely on it in the lurch. Democratic operatives warn it could turn a significant political asset into a liability just months before an election in which Republicans are historically favored to make gains. \u201cLetting the extremely popular child care tax credit expire would be exactly the type of mistake we can\u2019t afford,\u201d Tyler Law, a Democratic consultant who worked for the party\u2019s House election arm during the 2018 blue wave, said. \u201cDemocrats need to deliver win after win after win to show voters we can govern and deserve to stay in power,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet for success, but there\u2019s certainly a recipe for disaster: failing to pass the Biden agenda.\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the child tax credit has had a major impact in alleviating poverty and held it up as an example that says Democrats, when in charge, can help Americans. \u201cThe idea of letting it expire, I think, would be horrific,\u201d he said. While Democrats battle over what provisions make it into the bill, they appear to agree unanimously that the money for kids should be extended \u2014 from centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., to progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. But the details are unclear. The House version of the bill extends the payments through 2025. That may be adjusted as lawmakers sort out how to cut down the plan's price tag to get the centrists on board. And the income threshold for who is eligible may be adjusted as Manchin has demanded additional means-testing for the various programs in the bill. \u201cThere's some differences of opinion about how to do it, and how long to fund it, etcetera. And it has to fit within the overall top line of the bill,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. \u201cBut every Dem really wants it to happen.\u201d Republicans are adamantly opposed to the program and say it should expire. \u201cThe federal government shouldn't be in the business of just handing out money because you have kids,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said. \u201cThat's ridiculous.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Democrats of \u201ctrying to build a permanent welfare class in the country,\u201d saying the child tax credit includes \u201cdistributing more borrowed money to people who don't have a need for it.\u201d Some Democrats are spoiling for that fight. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the party\u2019s House campaign arm, projected confidence that Democrats will pass the bill, extend the child cash payments and then run on them. \u201cWe're going to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact that the Republicans have opposed it at every step of the way will come back to haunt them. I believe that it's exactly that type of thing that is the anvil on which we will hammer them in 2022.\u201d Sean McElwee, a progressive pollster who has been cited by the White House, said his firm has found that voters who received the child cash payment approve of Biden's job performance by a wide margin of 66 percent to 32 percent, whereas voters who haven't gotten it split evenly with 49 percent approving and disapproving. The firm, Data for Progress, found that those who voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020 and who receive the child tax credit register 79 percent disapproval of Biden, whereas 92 percent of those who do not receive it disapprove of the president. \u201cEnding the child tax credit would risk washing away these key persuasion gains that will be necessary to win in 2022 and 2024,\u201d McElwee said. Overall, the child cash payments are supported by 59 percent of U.S. adults, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. That includes 75 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of Republicans. Some of the states with the highest average per-month cash payments are conservative states. Progressives cite the program as an example of how government can make Americans' lives better. \u201cWe already have powerful data showing us that this tax credit is reducing hunger in America. It's providing school shoes and backpacks for kids to be able to go back to school,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u201cWe need to protect this \u2014 not just because it expires in an election year.

Because everyone else is. The nine-episode horror series on Netflix has hit No. 1 in 90 of the streaming service\u2019s markets around the world, including South Korea, where it was made. \u201cI got to the point where I could not hold a conversation without watching the show,\u201d said Jung Dunn, a security analyst in Seoul, the South Korean capital. But the show also strikes a nerve because it unflinchingly addresses a problem that is particularly entrenched in South Korea: debt and the never-ending struggle to pay it off. The cast of \u201cSquid Game\u201d features some of South Korea\u2019s biggest stars, including Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist, Seong Gi-hun, a hopelessly indebted father who receives a business card from a stranger offering him a way out. Along with 455 other contestants \u2014 from all walks of life but all deeply in debt too \u2014 he agrees to compete for a cash prize of 45.6 billion won (about $38 million) by playing a series of traditional Korean children\u2019s games, only to discover that elimination from each round means death. \u201cThere\u2019s this dissonance between Korean pride that this Korean show is dominating Netflix all around the world, and the discomfort with what the show appears to expose about Korea,\u201d said CedarBough Saeji, an assistant professor of Korean and East Asian studies at Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea. \u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing.\u201d That South Korea also produced \u201cParasite,\u201d the 2020 Oscar winner for best picture that also focused on themes of inequality, has probably accentuated this discomfort, Saeji said. Still, \u201cSquid Game\u201d is wildly popular in its home country. The show was released on Sept. 17 just before Chuseok, a Korean holiday similar to Thanksgiving when families gather, the perfect time for binge-watching. The surge in network traffic led one internet service provider to sue Netflix to cover its costs. The fervor has also spilled over into real life. A street vendor in Seoul who provided the makers of \u201cSquid Game\u201d with dalgona, a brittle sugar candy at the center of one of the games, told Reuters that he had seen a boom in business. Thousands of curious South Koreans also tried the eight-digit phone number that appears on the business card, which the show\u2019s makers didn\u2019t realize would reach an actual person. The owner of the number, and even people with similar numbers, have been inundated with calls and messages at all hours. On Wednesday, Netflix said it was working with the show\u2019s local production company to address the issue, including editing scenes to remove the number. Park Sae-ha, a senior studying economics at Yonsei University in Seoul, said \u201cSquid Game\u201d was \u201cspell-binding because it was so explicit and blunt.\u201d \u201cAlthough I am young, I could easily relate to the hard reality of a very competitive society,\u201d she said. That intense competitiveness may be one reason South Korea has been so successful, with a period of rapid industrialization starting in the 1960s that turned it into the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. But as in many other countries, a university degree and a white-collar job don\u2019t guarantee the financial security they used to, Saeji said. With an average income of about $42,000 a year, many Koreans now find they have to borrow to keep up. Fueled by low interest rates, household debt in South Korea has grown significantly in recent years, and is now equal to the country\u2019s annual GDP. (In the U.S., by contrast, household debt is about 80 percent of GDP.) People may rack up debt because of credit card spending, unemployment or gambling losses, but a large chunk of it is tied to real estate. Housing prices have been rising fast, especially under President Moon Jae-in, and the average price of an apartment in Seoul is nearing $1 million. Lending curbs and efforts to cool the housing market have done little to rein in household borrowing. In addition to housing, some Koreans, especially young people, borrow money to invest in cryptocurrency. Many Koreans start out by borrowing from legitimate financial institutions like banks, said Koo Se-Woong, a commentator on Korean culture based in Germany. When that avenue is exhausted, they may move on to second-tier lenders that charge higher interest. In the worst-case scenarios, he said, borrowers turn to loan shark operations that can charge triple-digit interest rates, \u201cand then you are pushed into situations from which you really cannot get out.\u201d According to some estimates, there are 400,000 Koreans in debt to loan sharks. \u201cWhen you look at the characters in the show who are participating in this game, they represent that demographic of the Koreans who are in the worst possible situation because of their personal debt,\u201d Koo said. In a recent widely shared Facebook post, Koo said he was shocked when a friend told him he was living paycheck to paycheck, despite having a good job. The friend \u201cdoesn't strike anyone as extravagant,\u201d Koo said, but struggles to afford the trappings of middle-class life: an apartment, a car and occasional travel with his wife and children. \"It's all paid for by loans, I am telling you,\" Koo said his friend told him. \"We just have no money.\" Jung, the security analyst, said the plot of \u201cSquid Game\u201d was easy to accept because \u201cit dealt with such familiar stories of debt-ridden people you come across in real life.\u201d \u201cThe story stems from a deeply rooted perception of how society looks at failure, especially individual financial failure,\u201d he said. Bankruptcy in South Korea is generally seen not as a chance to start over but as a devastating fate. That is underlined in \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Saeji said, when contestants are given the option to leave but choose to keep playing even at the risk of their lives. \u201cIn the regular world it\u2019s not just the death of their body, it\u2019s the death of their pride. It\u2019s the shame of having to be such an unsuccessful person in front of your family,\u201d she said. Viewers in South Korea say the show is all the more disturbing because it injects death and violence into playground games like Red Light, Green Light and tug of war. The show plays on childhood nostalgia \u201cand along with it the innocent times when you had no problems,\u201d said Kim Hern-sik, a pop culture critic in Seoul. \u201cYet the story tells you that escaping from reality is not the answer.\u201d \u201cSquid Game\u201d is \u201cfundamentally a Korean story, featuring games people would remember playing as kids,\u201d Don Kang, vice president of Korean content at Netflix, told NBC News in an email. \u201cSo we knew it would resonate with our members here.\u201d Its popularity in the West came as more of a surprise. But Korean cultural exports have been sweeping Asia for years, and Netflix was already betting on their growing appeal. The company is spending $500 million this year on Korean content, almost as much as it spent in the last five years. Saeji said that after decades of Western cultural influence, the success of \u201cSquid Game\u201d shows that South Korea can make a TV show with a Hollywood feel \u201cand they can do it better.\u201d While \u201cSquid Game\u201d is not the first story about a fight to the death, director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who has a film degree from the University of Southern California, made it influential in his own way, said Oh Dong-jin, a prominent film critic in South Korea. \u201cEvery movie borrows this and that from other movies. What matters, therefore, is how creatively you can borrow from different references,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, even from this standpoint, the traditional children\u2019s games the show uses make 'Squid Game' quite original.\u201d Margie Kim, a housewife in Seoul who is watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d with her family, said that while she enjoyed its intensity and pop-art-influenced visuals, the underlying messages were also important. \u201cI do feel the pain of what our society is going through,\u201d she said. The show deals with so many pressing issues, she said\u2014income inequality, youth unemployment, a rapidly aging society\u2014that it\u2019s something her entire family can relate to and talk about. \u201cSo many middle-class, ordinary people live with so much debt,\u201d she said. \u201cI could totally empathize with people who joined the game.\u201d Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Stella Kim reported from Los Angeles.", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/working-companies-owned-well-heeled-private-equity-firms-can-mean-n1281146", "title": "Working for companies owned by well-heeled private-equity firms can mean lower wages for employees", "subtitle": "Workers at some fast-food chains owned by public firms are getting better wages now.

They were like family, she said, and she believes they\u2019ve appreciated her attentiveness, especially during Covid-19. Not so, the nursing home\u2019s new owner, Jordan said. After Complete Care Management, the largest for-profit nursing home operator in New Jersey, took over the 150-bed Marcella Center in April, it slashed worker benefits, she and other employees as well as a representative from their union told NBC News. Amid the pandemic, Jordan\u2019s paid holidays were reduced, and her monthly health insurance costs more than tripled, she said. The company stopped contributing to the employee pension, replacing it with a 401(k) plan that had no employer match or contribution. Complete Care took away vision insurance and stopped a reimbursement program covering employee education costs, so Jordan, 45, won\u2019t be able to recoup money she spent working toward a degree to become a licensed practical nurse. \u201cI put all my effort into this company, and someone else took over and they don\u2019t want to give us what we deserve,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s business. It\u2019s not about the staff and the residents. It\u2019s only about making profits.\u201d In late September, Jordan quit her position at the facility. The reduced benefits and deteriorating work conditions got to be too much, she said. When Complete Care came in, Jordan and other Marcella workers were operating under a union contract struck with the facility\u2019s previous owner. Complete Care did away with that contract, which also covered four other unionized New Jersey nursing facilities it recently acquired, according to the Service Employees International Union. Complete Care owns 61 facilities in eight states, including Connecticut, Maryland and Wisconsin. It is backed by a private-equity firm called Peace Capital in Lakewood, New Jersey, whose principal owner is Sam Stein. Jordan and her fellow workers are not alone in experiencing reduced circumstances after their company is taken over by a private-equity firm. The new titans of finance, these firms use large pools of debt \u2014 typically raised in what's called the leveraged loan market \u2014 to acquire companies they hope to resell in a few years at a profit. Among companies raising money in this loan market during the past three years, debt levels at private-equity-backed entities were at least 30 percent higher than debt levels at companies not backed by private equity, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. But the heavy debt loads they take on, combined with pressure to flip acquired companies quickly, increases the likelihood that private-equity firms will have to cut costs in the operations that they buy. Often, the first to the chopping block is the company\u2019s workforce. A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research lays this out. Researchers analyzed almost 10,000 debt-fueled buyouts between 1980 and 2013 and found that employment fell by 13 percent when a private-equity firm took over a public company. Employment declined by even more \u2014 16 percent \u2014 when private equity acquired a unit or division of a company. Eileen Appelbaum is an economist and co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, and co-author of \"Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street.\" Her study of private equity has led her to conclude that the industry\u2019s growing clout is not only a concern for workers, but also has the potential to harm the nation\u2019s broader economy. \u201cYou have a lot more ownership of productive resources by investors who don\u2019t know an industry, don\u2019t understand the value of skilled workers and who are just in it to make their profit and get out,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cThat erodes productivity.\u201d Almost 12 million employees, or roughly 7 percent of the U.S. labor force, work for private-equity-backed businesses, according to the American Investment Council, an industry lobbying group. These companies generated about 6.5 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product last year, the group said. The council said private-equity firms create jobs, support businesses and help provide comfortable retirements for pensioners invested in the strategy. A spokeswoman for Complete Care echoed this view. She said the company is committed to the long-term viability of its facilities, adding in a statement: \u201cWe offer a comprehensive health plan and competitive benefits, and our facilities are known as great places to work.\u201d The company is negotiating a new union contract, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, though, care at the Marcella facility is declining, Jordan said, days after she quit. \u201cWe were very short-staffed,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think the residents pick up on that because it takes longer to answer a call.\u201d In a statement, a spokesperson for Complete Care said, \u201cComplete Care at Marcella consistently maintains state mandated ratios. ... We take whatever measures necessary to ensure that we have proper staffing to meet the needs of those in our care, including bringing in agency staff and offering bonuses as needed.\" Private equity is a sophisticated investment strategy that has grown furiously in recent years. At the end of last year, assets under management at the firms worldwide stood at $5 trillion, up from $1.5 trillion over the past decade, according to Preqin, a financial data provider. The number of funds devoted to these activities has more than doubled during that period, and last year, private-equity firms paid some $600 billion to acquire companies, up from $250 billion 10 years earlier. Private-equity firms began their climb to power in the 1980s; then they were known as leveraged buyout shops, because of the debt they use. The $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988 by private-equity giant Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts brought such deals to center stage. In recent years, as prevailing interest rates collapsed, private-equity operations have been able to take on greater amounts of low-cost debt to make their acquisitions. Through Sept. 27, for example, $472 billion of leveraged loans were issued, up from $237 billion issued during the same period in 2019, according to LCD of S&P Global. Outside investors, such as public pension funds and endowments, pour money into these takeover deals in the hopes of generating high returns. But recently, as the stock market has roared, outsize returns in private equity have all but vanished, academic studies show, and they are now in line with overall market performance. Nevertheless, more companies are owned by private-equity firms now than trade on the nation\u2019s stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, private-equity firms\u2019 rising dominance has generated immense wealth for their executives. The value of Sam Stein's holdings in Complete Care could not be determined and the company declined to provide it, but it is almost certainly dwarfed by those of Stephen Schwarzman, head of Blackstone Group. A close adviser to Donald Trump during his presidency, Schwarzman is worth $35 billion, according to Forbes magazine, up from $15 billion in 2020. Private equity also benefited from recent government interventions related to the Covid pandemic, documents show. At least $5 billion in federal bailout money went to companies backed by large and well-capitalized private-equity firms, according to a recent report from Americans for Financial Reform. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board launched an unprecedented $750 billion program to prop up the corporate bond market, where many of these firms raise money for their buyouts. Among the bonds purchased by the Fed, documents show, were those issued by Blackstone and another private-equity giant, Apollo Global Management, founded by Leon Black. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently testified that the agency would increase its scrutiny on fee disclosures and conflicts of interest among private funds, to ensure their practices don't put investors in these strategies at a disadvantage. And Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a late September memo outlining the agency's priorities that \"the growing role of private equity\" invites an examination of how these firms' business models \"may facilitate unfair methods of competition and consumer protection violations.\" Finally, the Democrats\u2019 proposed tax increase on capital gains may crimp private-equity executives\u2019 earnings. A key reason many of these executives have been able to amass such fortunes is that so much of their earnings are taxed as capital gains with a top rate of 20 percent, not at the higher 37 percent rate that can apply to income. This is a benefit they've tapped for decades, often allowing them to pay a lower tax rate on earnings than a secretary or a teacher might. One of the nation\u2019s biggest private-equity employers is Roark Capital of Atlanta. It owns Inspire Brands \u2014 parent company to an array of fast-food chains that includes Arby\u2019s, Dunkin\u2019, Baskin-Robbins and Sonic \u2014 and other brands such as Cinnabon and Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee. NBC News estimates that more than 700,000 people work at Inspire Brands, many at independently owned franchise stores. Roark is named for the libertarian protagonist in \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d by Ayn Rand, whose life \u201cexemplified the qualities of independence and integrity,\u201d the company\u2019s website said. One of libertarianism's basic tenets is limited government, but three dozen companies owned by Roark obtained $183 million in federal assistance under the CARES Act, according to the Americans for Financial Reform report. Asked whether this acceptance of government funding ran counter to a limited government stance, Roark declined to comment through a spokeswoman. Zella Roberts, a recent graduate of Warren Wilson College near Asheville, North Carolina, worked as a carhop at a Sonic Drive-In earlier this year to help pay tuition. Her all-in pay plummeted during the pandemic, Roberts told NBC News, because customers\u2019 cash usage fell and Sonic did not allow tips on credit cards. Roberts said she and some colleagues sent an email to Roark Capital \"explaining the conditions that Sonic workers experience. The big ask was to put pressure on Sonic corporate to make these changes.\" She said she never heard back about that or other messages sent to Neal Aronson, managing partner and founder of Roark Capital. Aronson is the controlling owner of Roark, regulatory filings show, which has $18.6 billion in assets under management. Through a spokeswoman, Aronson declined to comment. In January, after Roberts had collected 7,800 signatures on a petition asking Roark to change its policy, the company allowed tips on credit card orders placed through its app. An improvement, Roberts acknowledged, but such orders are a small percentage of those made via credit cards, she pointed out. The Inspire Brands spokesman said barring tips on credit cards \u201cis a technology limitation that we inherited when we purchased the brand\u201d in 2018. \u201cWe are now working on implementing the credit card tipping capability,\u201d he said. Inspire Brands has also worked to battle the Raise the Wage Act, which has been introduced in Congress every year since 2017 and would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour among workers like Roberts. In March, Inspire sent a memo to franchise owners highlighting its lobbying success in opposing the change. Describing its efforts, Inspire said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you\u2019re on the menu, and you can guarantee your opponents are eating!\u201d Chris Fuller, a spokesman for Inspire Brands, said the company fought the national minimum wage legislation because \u201cwe don\u2019t support a one-size-fits-all approach to the minimum wage. We believe in letting the local markets dictate.\u201d He added: \u201cMore than 90 percent of our team members at corporate-owned restaurants are above the state or local minimum wage.\u201d Some Inspire Brands workers have taken matters into their own hands. This summer, Matthew Honeycutt, 18, was working at an Arby\u2019s in Charlotte, North Carolina, making $9.50 an hour as a shift manager. He supports an 8-month-old son. On July 20, he and a group of workers walked off the job seeking a pay raise, forcing managers to close the Arby\u2019s store two hours early, Honeycutt said. That got management\u2019s attention, he said. \u201cThe strike was on a Tuesday, and it was about Thursday when he started getting the raises out,\u201d Honeycutt said of his boss, who gave him a 50-cents-an-hour raise. \"Every kind of worker you can think of is working so hard, but they're not getting paid what they\u2019re worth.\" Honeycutt\u2019s boss did not respond to a voicemail message seeking comment. In mid-September, Honeycutt quit his job at Arby's for a higher-paying position elsewhere. While Inspire Brands fights against a higher minimum wage, some other restaurant companies owned by publicly traded companies are taking a different approach. They say increasing worker pay is good for business. In February, Robert Verostek, the chief financial officer of restaurant chain Denny\u2019s, told investors that paying a higher wage to its workers in California had resulted in \u201cnot just positive sales, but positive guest traffic.\u201d And in May, McDonald's began increasing pay by 10 percent for almost 37,000 workers in company-owned stores. Shift managers like Honeycutt, who earned $10 at Arby\u2019s, are earning between $15 and $20 an hour depending on the location, McDonald\u2019s said. Sean Dunlop, an equity analyst at Morningstar Research, said Inspire Brands is a well-managed company. But increasing pay and benefits among workers is an industry trend it won't be able to resist. \"As you\u2019re thinking about bigger chains, not only are they making a broader push to a $15 average wage at restaurants, you\u2019ve also seen them offer tuition assistance, paid time off, retention bonuses and referral bonuses as they\u2019ve been trying to attract workers,\" Dunlop said. \"Inspire Brands, if they want to compete, are going to be forced to raise wages. They're going to have to, whether they want to or not.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/silicon-valley-area-food-banks-strain-under-growing-logistical-needs-n1281047", "title": "Silicon Valley area food banks strain under growing logistical needs of poverty", "subtitle": "\u201cInfrastructure requirements have sorely taxed the charitable food system at a time when demand is still extraordinarily high,\u201d one expert said.", "author": "By Cyrus Farivar", "section": null, "body": "RICHMOND, Calif. \u2014 On a recent unseasonably warm October day, dozens of Californians gathered at a food distribution site on a vast, unshaded blacktop space behind an elementary school. In one hour, 193 people waited patiently to fill their carts and shopping bags with produce like bell peppers, apples, onions and squash from the side of a massive truck. \u201cThat\u2019s a record for this year,\u201d said Matthew Durkin, 30, the mobile distribution supervisor, while nodding at the clients and noting that he usually sees only about 160 people. \u201cIt means there\u2019s an increased need.\u201d Durkin, of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, says that while demand for free food has slowed slightly from the start of the pandemic, people are still hungry. \u201cWe have seen another jump in numbers within the last few months. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, adding that many clients have told them how much they fear returning to work. \"They are concerned about Covid-19 surges, as so many of us are, and some of them may need to stay available for unexpected changes in child care and school due to Covid exposures or cases.\u201d More than 18 months into the pandemic, San Francisco Bay Area nonprofit organizations, from food banks to shelters for domestic violence victims, say that they are seeing more demand for their services than they ever saw before the pandemic. Even now, there are still two members of the California National Guard working at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties\u2019 central warehouse in Fairfield. As the pandemic drags on, these support facilities are also struggling with supply chain problems to meet the seemingly endless demand. It presents even more challenges as supplies and workers grow more scarce. Joel Sjostrom, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, has watched the food bank\u2019s demand grow to 300,000 people at the height of the pandemic from 178,000 before the pandemic began. He is now still trying to find support for 240,000 clients each month. Almost immediately after the March 2020 shelter-in-place order was instituted, he said, his organization lost 35 percent of its volunteer workforce because it depends so heavily on older volunteers who were scared to work before they were vaccinated. He had to call in members of the California National Guard, two of which remain. \u201cTo meet those volume increases, we have had to step up facilities and transportation,\u201d Sjostrom added. \u201cI had heard of the National Guard being helpful to others in Southern California.\u201d At one point, there were as many as 25 soldiers working to help this one bank. In California, the National Guard, as of Thursday, still had 140 soldiers deployed to food banks across 16 counties, down from a high of 767 in April 2020, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan M. Shiroma, a California National Guard spokesperson. But the National Guard is gradually trying to cut those numbers back and deploy these workers to other missions. In addition to help from the National Guard, Sjostrom has hired more full-time staff. But even now, even with 16 drivers, he still would like four more \u201cClass A\u201d drivers who can operate big rig trucks. In order to stay competitive with other outfits that employ drivers, he said he has had to raise his rates from $28 per hour to $30 per hour. \u201cIt\u2019s truly market pressure,\u201d Sjostrom said. \u201cAmazon has ads out, as does Hello Fresh, and driver demand is everywhere.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/traffic-stops-are-flashpoint-policing-america-reformers-are-winning-big-n1280594", "title": "Police face a 'crisis of trust' with Black motorists.

Police chiefs aren't happy.", "author": "By Simone Weichselbaum, Emily R. Siegel and Andrew Blankstein", "section": null, "body": "In the months after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, public defenders in Virginia saw an opportunity to overhaul policing in the state. Among their key priorities to address racial disparities: a ban on traffic stops for such infractions as broken taillights, tinted windows and the aroma of marijuana. What happened next stunned police officials across Virginia. In just three months, the ban the public defenders pitched to Democratic legislators sailed to the governor\u2019s desk and was signed into law. With Covid-19 shutting down the state Capitol and forcing the legislative sessions to take place via Zoom, the law enforcement officials who objected to the bill had failed to galvanize the opposition. In March, Virginia became the first state to prohibit the kind of low-level traffic stops that disproportionately affect people of color and are often used as pretexts to search for drugs and weapons. An NBC News analysis of the early data shows that the measure is having an impact on the percentage of Black motorists searched by police during traffic stops. \u201cAs public defenders, we aren\u2019t exactly used to winning, let alone winning big,\u201d said Brad Haywood, the chief public defender for Arlington County and executive director of Justice Forward, a criminal justice reform organization made up of public defenders across the state. \u201cThis will dramatically reduce race-based policing and impact so many lives.\u201d Long a cornerstone of American law enforcement, the traffic stop has emerged as a flashpoint in the debate over police reform. Over the last 20 months, district attorneys in California and Minnesota have ordered prosecutors to drop cases in which officers found guns or drugs during traffic stops for minor infractions. Other states, including Washington and Massachusetts, are considering restrictions similar to Virginia\u2019s. Proponents describe the measures as a long overdue step in banishing a tactic that targets mainly Black drivers and fails to improve public safety. But many law enforcement officials argue that they\u2019re being stripped of a crucial tool that they say helps to reduce vehicle deaths and remove criminals, guns and drugs from the streets, although the police chiefs and sheriffs interviewed for this article struggled to provide data backing up their case. Maggie DeBoard, the chief of the Herndon Police Department in Virginia, said stripping police of the ability to make certain traffic stops will make the roads more susceptible to traffic accidents and create fewer opportunities for officers to encounter people who should be off the streets. \u201cWe are eliminating more and more interactions with criminals by not allowing us to enforce the laws that are on the books,\u201d said DeBoard, who was the president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police as the group fought the bill. \u201cA lot of times you stop a vehicle, you have no idea the race, color, creed, religion of the person you're stopping,\u201d DeBoard said. \u201cYou see a violation, you stop the car. And at night, you definitely don\u2019t know who you\u2019re stopping. So it is not about targeting.\u201d Virginia started collecting detailed traffic stop statistics only in June 2020. The early data suggest that the law is having some effect on how the roads are policed. In the first four months after the law was enacted \u2014 March to June \u2014 the number of overall traffic stops rose by 7 percent compared to the previous four months, which experts said isn\u2019t surprising given that warmer weather tends to attract more drivers to the roads. But the number of motorists subjected to searches after having been pulled over \u2014 the category that the reformers care about most \u2014 dropped sharply, according to an NBC News analysis of police data obtained in a public records request. The number of Black drivers who were searched fell by 40 percent, and the number of white drivers dropped by 30 percent, the data show. Black people still accounted for about 30 percent of all traffic stops \u2014 the same percentage as before the law was changed \u2014 even though they are about 20 percent of the population of Virginia. White people, who make up 65 percent of the population, accounted for slightly under 65 percent of the stops before and after the law was changed, the early data show. Da\u2019Quan Marcell Love, the executive director of the Virginia NAACP, said the decline in the number of searches of Black drivers shows that the reforms are broadly working. But he said advocates are waiting to see how the situation plays out in the long term. \u201cWe have to give it time to work,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe are not launching a celebration any time soon.\u201d Officers stop about 20 million drivers a year, according to federal estimates, for reasons from speeding to blowing through reds light to expired tags. The vast majority of the encounters last only a few minutes and result in tickets or warnings, research shows. Police across the country have long been criticized for using minor infractions such as broken taillights as reasons to stop motorists and investigate them for possible crimes. Criminologists and civil rights lawyers have panned the tactic as a fishing expedition rife with racial bias that yields few results. Frank Baumgartner, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed more than 24 million traffic stops across North Carolina from 2002 to 2020. He found that the encounters led to arrests about 2 percent of the time. Searches also rarely occurred, and when they did, weapons were discovered in one-tenth of 1 percent of incidents. Black people were the subjects of nearly half the stops, Baumgartner found, even though they are only 21 percent of the state\u2019s population. \u201cFor every one bad guy they catch, they alienate, like, 18 young Black men,\u201d Baumgartner said. \u201cThat's where we get to the crisis of trust with the police.\u201d That type of traffic stop led to two of the highest-profile police killings in recent years: those of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Both were Black men who were shot and killed by officers after having been pulled over for broken taillights. Officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder of Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked coast-to-coast calls for reform. Faced with overwhelming public pressure, elected officials are increasingly moving forward with measures to strip away police powers regardless of whether law enforcement leaders support them. Last month, the top prosecutor in Ramsey County, Minnesota, where Castile was killed, announced that he would no longer prosecute  most cases that stem from non-public-safety traffic stops, such as expired tags. He cited the disproportionate impact on people of color, especially Black people, among other reasons. \u201cThe outcome of these stops is that it yields very, very little contraband,\u201d said the prosecutor, County Attorney John Choi. \u201cIf I thought that this would lead to more problems from a public safety perspective, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Larger police departments in Choi\u2019s county supported the move, but the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association described it as \u201cinsulting.\u201d More statewide bans may be on the horizon as politicians continue to openly shrug off opposition from police. Inspired by the change in Virginia\u2019s law, Joe Nguyen, a Democratic state senator in Washington, recently introduced legislation that would prohibit police from pulling motorists over for failing to stop, driving without licenses and other violations. \u201cWe passed a few bills last year that didn\u2019t have law enforcement support, so it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of,\u201d Nguyen said. Some police chiefs across the country, in places like Oakland, California; Minneapolis; and Portland, Oregon, have retooled their traffic enforcement policies to avoid unnecessary confrontations with drivers. The Oakland Police Department issued a directive five years ago discouraging officers from pulling people over for low-level offenses like equipment violations and expired registrations. Since the policies were put in place, the percentage of Black drivers who were stopped fell from 62 percent in 2016 to 51 percent in 2019. The police department enlisted Stanford University to examine its data, which showed that under 3 percent of stops in 2013 and 2014 were linked to more serious crimes. Deputy Police Chief Christopher Bolton urged Oakland police brass reluctant to reform to take a hard look at the statistics. \u201cWhy are we continuing to do those stops when the data is showing that not only is it not effective and efficient, but it could very well be damaging public trust and confidence in what our strategies are?\u201d Bolton asked. But in San Francisco, District Attorney Chesa Boudin\u2019s push to end \u201cpretextual\u201d traffic stops has met fierce resistance from the police. During his second month in office, Boudin told staff members to refrain from prosecuting people who were stopped for minor infractions and found to have \u201ccontraband,\u201d including drugs and guns. Union officials slammed Boudin for creating an environment in which criminals feel comfortable to break the law without fear of punishment. \u201cIf they want to continue to handcuff the police in doing their jobs, the unintended consequences are going to be more crime victims,\u201d said Tony Montoya, the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Union officials blame Boudin\u2019s new traffic policy for the release of a man who was accused of fatally shooting two people weeks after he was pulled over and found with an assault-style rifle without a serial number. The district attorney\u2019s office said its decision not to pursue charges against the suspect, Robert Newt, had nothing to do with the circumstances of the stop. The investigators didn\u2019t provide DNA or fingerprints that could tie Newt to the gun, Boudin\u2019s office said. Rachel Marshall, a spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office, said the policy \u201coffers room for exceptions.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office said it has rejected about one to two cases a month because of Boudin\u2019s rules, for a total of 11 this year. \u201cRacial profiling undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and fosters distrust in communities of color \u2014 all of which decreases public safety,\u201d Marshall said. Police chiefs and sheriffs in Virginia say that the state\u2019s ban went too far and that it is putting lives at risk at a time when murders and fatal accidents are already soaring. The original bill, in fact, would have gone even further by blocking police from stopping vehicles with no front lights. The governor\u2019s office cut the measure after Chesterfield County Police Chief Jeffrey Katz blasted it in a viral Facebook post. The new law permits a driver to have one broken headlight. \u201cLawmakers were making decisions based on the loudest voices in the room, but not necessarily the most informed voices in the room,\u201d Katz said in an interview. \u201cAnd all you have to do is look at the crime rate in the last year and a half.\u201d As in many other states, the number of murders in Virginia has risen sharply since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Virginia State Police. Even though officers can still cite people for speeding and erratic driving, rural county sheriffs said the ban creates an atmosphere in which reckless motorists feel safe to break the law, and they warned that traffic deaths will rise. Fatal traffic accidents in the six months after the law was changed hit a 10-year high, according to an NBC News analysis that compared them to the same period going back to 2011. Jessica Cowardin, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said the rise in traffic deaths mirrors national figures, which are also up. Federal officials blame the increase on speeding, drunk drivers and people who don\u2019t wear seat belts \u2014 violations that police in Virginia can still enforce. For some Virginia police chiefs, the concerns go beyond traffic accidents. In Petersburg, about 20 miles south of Richmond, officers confiscated more than 1,000 guns in the three years leading up to the ban, often in vehicle stops, Police Chief Travis Christian said. But his office was unable to provide data backing up the claim. The analysis of arrest data found that weapons were discovered in about 7 percent of traffic stops in Petersburg from 2018 to 2020. As a chief who is Black, Christian said he is \u201ctorn\u201d over the new law. He acknowledged that Black Virginians feel targeted by police when they are behind the wheel, but he said he still wants the ban reversed. \u201cIt has given us the ability to use it as an investigative tool to get to other crimes that have been committed,\u201d Christian said. \u201cThat tool has been eliminated for us.\u201d David Weisburd, a criminology professor and the executive director of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, said he wasn\u2019t aware of any data that support the claim that low-level traffic stops help to reduce crime. \u201cIt is time, in my view, for the police to bring evidence to their arguments,\u201d Weisburd said. \u201cThat evidence could help in deciding what is reasonable or unreasonable or what is good policing from what is awful policing.\u201d The new law hasn\u2019t put an end to controversial stops in Virginia. Five days after the ban went into effect, state troopers pulled over Juanisha Brooks, 35, a Black woman who is a senior video producer for the Defense Department, as she was driving along a highway in Northern Virginia. A trooper ordered her to get out of the vehicle several times, saying he wanted to show her what was wrong with her car. Brooks refused, saying she didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t tell her while she remained in the vehicle. Dashcam video appears to show the trooper dragging Brooks out of the seat and pushing her up against her car. Officers charged her with reckless driving, eluding, obstruction of justice and failing to have her headlights on. Prosecutors dropped the case, noting that the stop was illegal because of the reforms. Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, insisted that the arrest was fair because Brooks refused to comply with the trooper\u2019s commands. State Police conducted an internal investigation; Geller said she couldn\u2019t share whether the trooper was disciplined because of privacy rules. \u201cI was afraid for my life,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be another hashtag.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ems-services-warn-crippling-labor-shortage-undermining-911-system-rcna2677", "title": "EMS services warn of 'crippling labor shortage' undermining 911 system", "subtitle": "\u201cWe\u2019re not bleeding any longer \u2014 we\u2019re hemorrhaging,\u201d one ambulance service operator said of a decadelong worker shortage exacerbated by the pandemic.", "author": "By Phil McCausland", "section": null, "body": "The pandemic-induced shortage of emergency medical technicians and paramedics nationwide is so dire that ambulance service providers warn of sharp cuts to services and longer waits for 911 calls \u2014 even when it\u2019s a matter of life or death. Companies have had to close, consolidate or come up with new strategies to answer calls, said American Ambulance Association President Shawn Baird, who added that there is simply not enough EMS personnel to cover calls in many parts of the country, especially during the pandemic. The loss of staff to pandemic-related burnout and low wages has created a vicious cycle, requiring greater dependence on those workers who have stayed on. The situation has deteriorated to such a degree in recent months that ambulance services and industry leaders are pleading with Congress and state legislatures to help. \"The magnitude has really blown up over the last few months,\" Baird said. \"When you take a system that was already fragile and stretched it, because you didn't have enough people entering the field, then you throw a public health emergency and all of the additional burdens that it put on our workforce as well as the labor shortages across the entire economy, and it really has put us in a crisis mode.\" It's a crisis that has made it difficult to hire and even harder to retain EMTs and paramedics, according to a AAA survey of 258 EMS organizations across the country. In 2020, nearly a third of the workforce left their ambulance company after less than a year, the survey said. Eleven percent left within the first three months. \"It's almost unmanageable,\" said Ken Cummings, who leads Tri-Hospital EMS in Port Huron, Michigan. \"I don't think any EMS provider wants to go out in public and say that your service might be interrupted, but the reality is that because of the extremely low workforce situation right now, we are going to start to see delays. We're already seeing that throughout the country right now.\" Cummings said he currently has 10 openings, about 10 percent of his workforce. He's currently paying double overtime to fill the gap left by those empty positions, but that has increased the average work week of his paramedics by at least eight hours. The amount of money he's paying in overtime is also becoming untenable, and his workers are losing interest in the extra cash. \"We're spending money today that we're hoping we get tomorrow, to be real honest with you,\" he said. \"It's not a long-term solution.\" There are an estimated 1,000 open EMS positions in Michigan alone, Cummings said. The good news for Cummings is that he has a handful of students who will graduate next year from the paramedic program, but the churn is constant. The Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, also agreed to allocate $12.9 million of the state's budget to increase reimbursement rates. But that has not slowed the revolving-door nature of the job. Among full-time EMTs, 47 percent reported in 2020 that the reason for leaving was for a career or occupation change, according to the survey. That number is 45 percent among paramedics. \"In my experience running an EMS service, I've seen more than a few employees get into the industry and leave within six months,\" said Judd Smith, the program director of Texas EMS School in Abilene. \"I'll see people work for three weeks and then move on to the next thing.\" The decline in Texas has been particularly substantial. By mid-August, only 27 percent of licensed EMS professionals had submitted a patient care record, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, meaning that over 70 percent of licensed Texas EMTs did not work on an ambulance in the first eight months of the year. That represents a significant drop from the 43 percent of EMTs who submitted reports in 2020 and the 45 percent who did in 2019. The circumstances have pushed the American Ambulance Association and National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians to send a letter to Congress last week pushing for a hearing to address the shortfall and asking for more funding to increase wages. The letter warned that \"our nation\u2019s EMS system is facing a crippling workforce shortage, a long-term problem that has been building for more than a decade. It threatens to undermine our emergency 9-1-1 infrastructure and deserves urgent attention by the Congress.\" The pandemic has made a bad labor problem worse. The spread of the virus, the frequency of calls, worry of potential infection and the necessary safeguards that emergency personnel must take to protect themselves have created additional stress that has caused many to leave the field, providers said. Their departure has then increased the need for those who remain to work overtime, pushing even more to leave the field. The nationwide health emergency also caused many EMT and paramedic courses to shut down, meaning there is a dearth of students coming into the industry. \"We're not bleeding any longer \u2014 we're hemorrhaging,\" said Gary Wadaga, who operates Bay Ambulance in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Ambulance companies have faced years of workforce challenges that has damaged their ability to respond to calls quickly, but the situation is getting worse. Last year, because an ambulance service closed south of his company's service area, Wadaga had to take on an additional 100 square miles of territory. Now he covers 1,500 square miles and receives about 1,000 calls a year with six paramedic positions. The trouble is, he's been unable to fill two spots and has another two workers on leave, leaving him and one other person to respond to every emergency call that comes in. \"I've not seen it this bad in 41 years, and you can't just set that aside,\" said Wadaga, adding that the increasing demands of the job have caused him great anxiety. \"You want to be there for your community, but the fact that one day we're not going to have enough people absolutely bothers me.\" Ambulance companies once had the luxury of considering applicants, but that appears to be a concept of the past. Now companies are actively recruiting and even going after one another's employees because the pool of eligible workers is so small. \"Overall, it's robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Baird, \"because every community needs these folks.\" Wadaga and other ambulance service operators said the pandemic has increased the viciousness of a labor shortage and put the nation's emergency medical system at risk of a \"death spiral\" that could be difficult to pull out of. The salary requests of a shrinking workforce are getting higher as wages remain stagnant. The 2020 median pay for EMTs and paramedics was $36,650 per year or $17.62 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about a 7.5 percent increase since 2011. Advocates said the wages don't match the requirements of the job anymore. \"When you're an EMS provider putting your life on the line and entering into a closed environments with infectious patients and you can make more money to work in an Amazon warehouse, it becomes really difficult to retain people,\" said Robert Luckritz, who serves as chair of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians' EMS Workforce Committee. But it's not just retail and warehouse work that's calling. Luckritz said that hospitals facing their own nursing and health care worker shortages are at times actively recruiting EMT and paramedics, promising higher wages, better hours and increased benefits. That's an issue Luckritz and his colleagues are attempting to work on, but it's a challenge. They need more money to hire more people, but ambulance company rates are set by insurance providers and the government when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, which both contribute to the vast majority of calls, Luckritz said. \"Unlike much of the other industries across the country ... we're not able to raise our prices \u2014 our prices are set by the government,\" he said. \"So with reimbursement not keeping up with our costs, it makes it very difficult for us to compete for the workforce.\" The fear is that if the country doesn't face these problems now, they will be unfixable down the line. Baird, the AAA president, said that if things spiral too far down, \"we can\u2019t get people to even enter the field because it looks too daunting.\" \"We have to turn this around,\" he said. One silver lining is that online EMS programs, such as Smith's Texas EMS School, are seeing increased interest \u2014 even as nationwide there is a decline in enrollment in traditional programs. The number of applications for their EMT program, which can be completed in 10 to 18 weeks via a mix of online coursework and hands-on clinical and field experience, jumped from 495 applicants in 2019 to 1,469 in 2021. The jobs certainly are there waiting for them at graduation. \"I don't know of any one of our students that doesn't get hired within the first week of getting licensed,\" Smith said. \"We've even had a big number of them get hired before they even received their certification, so they start working as soon as they're done.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-stake-2022-hopes-child-cash-benefits-there-s-just-n1281142", "title": "Democrats stake 2022 hopes on child cash benefits.

But in doing so, they planted an election-year time bomb for their own party, and their only realistic hope of defusing it in time is to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s social spending bill. At the center of the American Rescue Plan is a monthly payment structured as a tax credit for the vast majority of families \u2014 of $300 per child under 6 years old or $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. The benefit has been well received in polls, and studies say it quickly lifted millions of U.S. kids out of poverty. But there\u2019s a catch: It is only authorized for 2021. The payments end in December unless extended. With Republicans opposed, the only realistic vehicle to extend them is Biden\u2019s multitrillion-dollar bill, which Democratic leaders are working feverishly to craft. Allowing the payments to expire would risk erasing the economic gains and leaving struggling parents who have come to rely on it in the lurch. Democratic operatives warn it could turn a significant political asset into a liability just months before an election in which Republicans are historically favored to make gains. \u201cLetting the extremely popular child care tax credit expire would be exactly the type of mistake we can\u2019t afford,\u201d Tyler Law, a Democratic consultant who worked for the party\u2019s House election arm during the 2018 blue wave, said. \u201cDemocrats need to deliver win after win after win to show voters we can govern and deserve to stay in power,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet for success, but there\u2019s certainly a recipe for disaster: failing to pass the Biden agenda.\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the child tax credit has had a major impact in alleviating poverty and held it up as an example that says Democrats, when in charge, can help Americans. \u201cThe idea of letting it expire, I think, would be horrific,\u201d he said. While Democrats battle over what provisions make it into the bill, they appear to agree unanimously that the money for kids should be extended \u2014 from centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., to progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. But the details are unclear. The House version of the bill extends the payments through 2025. That may be adjusted as lawmakers sort out how to cut down the plan's price tag to get the centrists on board. And the income threshold for who is eligible may be adjusted as Manchin has demanded additional means-testing for the various programs in the bill. \u201cThere's some differences of opinion about how to do it, and how long to fund it, etcetera. And it has to fit within the overall top line of the bill,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. \u201cBut every Dem really wants it to happen.\u201d Republicans are adamantly opposed to the program and say it should expire. \u201cThe federal government shouldn't be in the business of just handing out money because you have kids,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said. \u201cThat's ridiculous.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Democrats of \u201ctrying to build a permanent welfare class in the country,\u201d saying the child tax credit includes \u201cdistributing more borrowed money to people who don't have a need for it.\u201d Some Democrats are spoiling for that fight. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the party\u2019s House campaign arm, projected confidence that Democrats will pass the bill, extend the child cash payments and then run on them. \u201cWe're going to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact that the Republicans have opposed it at every step of the way will come back to haunt them. I believe that it's exactly that type of thing that is the anvil on which we will hammer them in 2022.\u201d Sean McElwee, a progressive pollster who has been cited by the White House, said his firm has found that voters who received the child cash payment approve of Biden's job performance by a wide margin of 66 percent to 32 percent, whereas voters who haven't gotten it split evenly with 49 percent approving and disapproving. The firm, Data for Progress, found that those who voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020 and who receive the child tax credit register 79 percent disapproval of Biden, whereas 92 percent of those who do not receive it disapprove of the president. \u201cEnding the child tax credit would risk washing away these key persuasion gains that will be necessary to win in 2022 and 2024,\u201d McElwee said. Overall, the child cash payments are supported by 59 percent of U.S. adults, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. That includes 75 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of Republicans. Some of the states with the highest average per-month cash payments are conservative states. Progressives cite the program as an example of how government can make Americans' lives better. \u201cWe already have powerful data showing us that this tax credit is reducing hunger in America. It's providing school shoes and backpacks for kids to be able to go back to school,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u201cWe need to protect this \u2014 not just because it expires in an election year. We need to protect it because this helps American families.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/squid-game-entertaining-world-there-s-different-feeling-south-korea-n1281119", "title": "'Squid Game' is entertaining the world. But there's a different feeling in South Korea", "subtitle": "\u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing,\" said Professor CedarBough Saeji.", "author": "By Jennifer Jett and Stella Kim", "section": null, "body": "HONG KONG \u2014 Why are South Koreans watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d? Because everyone else is. The nine-episode horror series on Netflix has hit No. 1 in 90 of the streaming service\u2019s markets around the world, including South Korea, where it was made. \u201cI got to the point where I could not hold a conversation without watching the show,\u201d said Jung Dunn, a security analyst in Seoul, the South Korean capital. But the show also strikes a nerve because it unflinchingly addresses a problem that is particularly entrenched in South Korea: debt and the never-ending struggle to pay it off. The cast of \u201cSquid Game\u201d features some of South Korea\u2019s biggest stars, including Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist, Seong Gi-hun, a hopelessly indebted father who receives a business card from a stranger offering him a way out. Along with 455 other contestants \u2014 from all walks of life but all deeply in debt too \u2014 he agrees to compete for a cash prize of 45.6 billion won (about $38 million) by playing a series of traditional Korean children\u2019s games, only to discover that elimination from each round means death. \u201cThere\u2019s this dissonance between Korean pride that this Korean show is dominating Netflix all around the world, and the discomfort with what the show appears to expose about Korea,\u201d said CedarBough Saeji, an assistant professor of Korean and East Asian studies at Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea. \u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing.\u201d That South Korea also produced \u201cParasite,\u201d the 2020 Oscar winner for best picture that also focused on themes of inequality, has probably accentuated this discomfort, Saeji said. Still, \u201cSquid Game\u201d is wildly popular in its home country. The show was released on Sept. 17 just before Chuseok, a Korean holiday similar to Thanksgiving when families gather, the perfect time for binge-watching. The surge in network traffic led one internet service provider to sue Netflix to cover its costs. The fervor has also spilled over into real life. A street vendor in Seoul who provided the makers of \u201cSquid Game\u201d with dalgona, a brittle sugar candy at the center of one of the games, told Reuters that he had seen a boom in business. Thousands of curious South Koreans also tried the eight-digit phone number that appears on the business card, which the show\u2019s makers didn\u2019t realize would reach an actual person. The owner of the number, and even people with similar numbers, have been inundated with calls and messages at all hours. On Wednesday, Netflix said it was working with the show\u2019s local production company to address the issue, including editing scenes to remove the number. Park Sae-ha, a senior studying economics at Yonsei University in Seoul, said \u201cSquid Game\u201d was \u201cspell-binding because it was so explicit and blunt.\u201d \u201cAlthough I am young, I could easily relate to the hard reality of a very competitive society,\u201d she said. That intense competitiveness may be one reason South Korea has been so successful, with a period of rapid industrialization starting in the 1960s that turned it into the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. But as in many other countries, a university degree and a white-collar job don\u2019t guarantee the financial security they used to, Saeji said. With an average income of about $42,000 a year, many Koreans now find they have to borrow to keep up. Fueled by low interest rates, household debt in South Korea has grown significantly in recent years, and is now equal to the country\u2019s annual GDP. (In the U.S., by contrast, household debt is about 80 percent of GDP.) People may rack up debt because of credit card spending, unemployment or gambling losses, but a large chunk of it is tied to real estate. Housing prices have been rising fast, especially under President Moon Jae-in, and the average price of an apartment in Seoul is nearing $1 million. Lending curbs and efforts to cool the housing market have done little to rein in household borrowing. In addition to housing, some Koreans, especially young people, borrow money to invest in cryptocurrency. Many Koreans start out by borrowing from legitimate financial institutions like banks, said Koo Se-Woong, a commentator on Korean culture based in Germany. When that avenue is exhausted, they may move on to second-tier lenders that charge higher interest. In the worst-case scenarios, he said, borrowers turn to loan shark operations that can charge triple-digit interest rates, \u201cand then you are pushed into situations from which you really cannot get out.\u201d According to some estimates, there are 400,000 Koreans in debt to loan sharks. \u201cWhen you look at the characters in the show who are participating in this game, they represent that demographic of the Koreans who are in the worst possible situation because of their personal debt,\u201d Koo said. In a recent widely shared Facebook post, Koo said he was shocked when a friend told him he was living paycheck to paycheck, despite having a good job. The friend \u201cdoesn't strike anyone as extravagant,\u201d Koo said, but struggles to afford the trappings of middle-class life: an apartment, a car and occasional travel with his wife and children. \"It's all paid for by loans, I am telling you,\" Koo said his friend told him. \"We just have no money.\" Jung, the security analyst, said the plot of \u201cSquid Game\u201d was easy to accept because \u201cit dealt with such familiar stories of debt-ridden people you come across in real life.\u201d \u201cThe story stems from a deeply rooted perception of how society looks at failure, especially individual financial failure,\u201d he said. Bankruptcy in South Korea is generally seen not as a chance to start over but as a devastating fate. That is underlined in \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Saeji said, when contestants are given the option to leave but choose to keep playing even at the risk of their lives. \u201cIn the regular world it\u2019s not just the death of their body, it\u2019s the death of their pride. It\u2019s the shame of having to be such an unsuccessful person in front of your family,\u201d she said. Viewers in South Korea say the show is all the more disturbing because it injects death and violence into playground games like Red Light, Green Light and tug of war. The show plays on childhood nostalgia \u201cand along with it the innocent times when you had no problems,\u201d said Kim Hern-sik, a pop culture critic in Seoul. \u201cYet the story tells you that escaping from reality is not the answer.\u201d \u201cSquid Game\u201d is \u201cfundamentally a Korean story, featuring games people would remember playing as kids,\u201d Don Kang, vice president of Korean content at Netflix, told NBC News in an email. \u201cSo we knew it would resonate with our members here.\u201d Its popularity in the West came as more of a surprise. But Korean cultural exports have been sweeping Asia for years, and Netflix was already betting on their growing appeal. The company is spending $500 million this year on Korean content, almost as much as it spent in the last five years. Saeji said that after decades of Western cultural influence, the success of \u201cSquid Game\u201d shows that South Korea can make a TV show with a Hollywood feel \u201cand they can do it better.\u201d While \u201cSquid Game\u201d is not the first story about a fight to the death, director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who has a film degree from the University of Southern California, made it influential in his own way, said Oh Dong-jin, a prominent film critic in South Korea. \u201cEvery movie borrows this and that from other movies. What matters, therefore, is how creatively you can borrow from different references,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, even from this standpoint, the traditional children\u2019s games the show uses make 'Squid Game' quite original.\u201d Margie Kim, a housewife in Seoul who is watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d with her family, said that while she enjoyed its intensity and pop-art-influenced visuals, the underlying messages were also important. \u201cI do feel the pain of what our society is going through,\u201d she said. The show deals with so many pressing issues, she said\u2014income inequality, youth unemployment, a rapidly aging society\u2014that it\u2019s something her entire family can relate to and talk about. \u201cSo many middle-class, ordinary people live with so much debt,\u201d she said. \u201cI could totally empathize with people who joined the game.\u201d Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Stella Kim reported from Los Angeles.", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/working-companies-owned-well-heeled-private-equity-firms-can-mean-n1281146", "title": "Working for companies owned by well-heeled private-equity firms can mean lower wages for employees", "subtitle": "Workers at some fast-food chains owned by public firms are getting better wages now. It\u2019s a different story at restaurants owned by private-equity firms.", "author": "By Gretchen Morgenson", "section": null, "body": "Alma Jordan, a certified nursing assistant at the Marcella Center nursing home in Burlington, New Jersey, respected the residents she cared for there over the past 16 years. They were like family, she said, and she believes they\u2019ve appreciated her attentiveness, especially during Covid-19. Not so, the nursing home\u2019s new owner, Jordan said. After Complete Care Management, the largest for-profit nursing home operator in New Jersey, took over the 150-bed Marcella Center in April, it slashed worker benefits, she and other employees as well as a representative from their union told NBC News. Amid the pandemic, Jordan\u2019s paid holidays were reduced, and her monthly health insurance costs more than tripled, she said. The company stopped contributing to the employee pension, replacing it with a 401(k) plan that had no employer match or contribution. Complete Care took away vision insurance and stopped a reimbursement program covering employee education costs, so Jordan, 45, won\u2019t be able to recoup money she spent working toward a degree to become a licensed practical nurse. \u201cI put all my effort into this company, and someone else took over and they don\u2019t want to give us what we deserve,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s business. It\u2019s not about the staff and the residents. It\u2019s only about making profits.\u201d In late September, Jordan quit her position at the facility. The reduced benefits and deteriorating work conditions got to be too much, she said. When Complete Care came in, Jordan and other Marcella workers were operating under a union contract struck with the facility\u2019s previous owner. Complete Care did away with that contract, which also covered four other unionized New Jersey nursing facilities it recently acquired, according to the Service Employees International Union. Complete Care owns 61 facilities in eight states, including Connecticut, Maryland and Wisconsin. It is backed by a private-equity firm called Peace Capital in Lakewood, New Jersey, whose principal owner is Sam Stein. Jordan and her fellow workers are not alone in experiencing reduced circumstances after their company is taken over by a private-equity firm. The new titans of finance, these firms use large pools of debt \u2014 typically raised in what's called the leveraged loan market \u2014 to acquire companies they hope to resell in a few years at a profit. Among companies raising money in this loan market during the past three years, debt levels at private-equity-backed entities were at least 30 percent higher than debt levels at companies not backed by private equity, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. But the heavy debt loads they take on, combined with pressure to flip acquired companies quickly, increases the likelihood that private-equity firms will have to cut costs in the operations that they buy. Often, the first to the chopping block is the company\u2019s workforce. A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research lays this out. Researchers analyzed almost 10,000 debt-fueled buyouts between 1980 and 2013 and found that employment fell by 13 percent when a private-equity firm took over a public company. Employment declined by even more \u2014 16 percent \u2014 when private equity acquired a unit or division of a company. Eileen Appelbaum is an economist and co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, and co-author of \"Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street.\" Her study of private equity has led her to conclude that the industry\u2019s growing clout is not only a concern for workers, but also has the potential to harm the nation\u2019s broader economy. \u201cYou have a lot more ownership of productive resources by investors who don\u2019t know an industry, don\u2019t understand the value of skilled workers and who are just in it to make their profit and get out,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cThat erodes productivity.\u201d Almost 12 million employees, or roughly 7 percent of the U.S. labor force, work for private-equity-backed businesses, according to the American Investment Council, an industry lobbying group. These companies generated about 6.5 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product last year, the group said. The council said private-equity firms create jobs, support businesses and help provide comfortable retirements for pensioners invested in the strategy. A spokeswoman for Complete Care echoed this view. She said the company is committed to the long-term viability of its facilities, adding in a statement: \u201cWe offer a comprehensive health plan and competitive benefits, and our facilities are known as great places to work.\u201d The company is negotiating a new union contract, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, though, care at the Marcella facility is declining, Jordan said, days after she quit. \u201cWe were very short-staffed,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think the residents pick up on that because it takes longer to answer a call.\u201d In a statement, a spokesperson for Complete Care said, \u201cComplete Care at Marcella consistently maintains state mandated ratios. ... We take whatever measures necessary to ensure that we have proper staffing to meet the needs of those in our care, including bringing in agency staff and offering bonuses as needed.\" Private equity is a sophisticated investment strategy that has grown furiously in recent years. At the end of last year, assets under management at the firms worldwide stood at $5 trillion, up from $1.5 trillion over the past decade, according to Preqin, a financial data provider. The number of funds devoted to these activities has more than doubled during that period, and last year, private-equity firms paid some $600 billion to acquire companies, up from $250 billion 10 years earlier. Private-equity firms began their climb to power in the 1980s; then they were known as leveraged buyout shops, because of the debt they use. The $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988 by private-equity giant Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts brought such deals to center stage. In recent years, as prevailing interest rates collapsed, private-equity operations have been able to take on greater amounts of low-cost debt to make their acquisitions. Through Sept. 27, for example, $472 billion of leveraged loans were issued, up from $237 billion issued during the same period in 2019, according to LCD of S&P Global. Outside investors, such as public pension funds and endowments, pour money into these takeover deals in the hopes of generating high returns. But recently, as the stock market has roared, outsize returns in private equity have all but vanished, academic studies show, and they are now in line with overall market performance. Nevertheless, more companies are owned by private-equity firms now than trade on the nation\u2019s stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, private-equity firms\u2019 rising dominance has generated immense wealth for their executives. The value of Sam Stein's holdings in Complete Care could not be determined and the company declined to provide it, but it is almost certainly dwarfed by those of Stephen Schwarzman, head of Blackstone Group. A close adviser to Donald Trump during his presidency, Schwarzman is worth $35 billion, according to Forbes magazine, up from $15 billion in 2020. Private equity also benefited from recent government interventions related to the Covid pandemic, documents show. At least $5 billion in federal bailout money went to companies backed by large and well-capitalized private-equity firms, according to a recent report from Americans for Financial Reform. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board launched an unprecedented $750 billion program to prop up the corporate bond market, where many of these firms raise money for their buyouts. Among the bonds purchased by the Fed, documents show, were those issued by Blackstone and another private-equity giant, Apollo Global Management, founded by Leon Black. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently testified that the agency would increase its scrutiny on fee disclosures and conflicts of interest among private funds, to ensure their practices don't put investors in these strategies at a disadvantage. And Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a late September memo outlining the agency's priorities that \"the growing role of private equity\" invites an examination of how these firms' business models \"may facilitate unfair methods of competition and consumer protection violations.\" Finally, the Democrats\u2019 proposed tax increase on capital gains may crimp private-equity executives\u2019 earnings. A key reason many of these executives have been able to amass such fortunes is that so much of their earnings are taxed as capital gains with a top rate of 20 percent, not at the higher 37 percent rate that can apply to income. This is a benefit they've tapped for decades, often allowing them to pay a lower tax rate on earnings than a secretary or a teacher might. One of the nation\u2019s biggest private-equity employers is Roark Capital of Atlanta. It owns Inspire Brands \u2014 parent company to an array of fast-food chains that includes Arby\u2019s, Dunkin\u2019, Baskin-Robbins and Sonic \u2014 and other brands such as Cinnabon and Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee. NBC News estimates that more than 700,000 people work at Inspire Brands, many at independently owned franchise stores. Roark is named for the libertarian protagonist in \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d by Ayn Rand, whose life \u201cexemplified the qualities of independence and integrity,\u201d the company\u2019s website said. One of libertarianism's basic tenets is limited government, but three dozen companies owned by Roark obtained $183 million in federal assistance under the CARES Act, according to the Americans for Financial Reform report. Asked whether this acceptance of government funding ran counter to a limited government stance, Roark declined to comment through a spokeswoman. Zella Roberts, a recent graduate of Warren Wilson College near Asheville, North Carolina, worked as a carhop at a Sonic Drive-In earlier this year to help pay tuition. Her all-in pay plummeted during the pandemic, Roberts told NBC News, because customers\u2019 cash usage fell and Sonic did not allow tips on credit cards. Roberts said she and some colleagues sent an email to Roark Capital \"explaining the conditions that Sonic workers experience. The big ask was to put pressure on Sonic corporate to make these changes.\" She said she never heard back about that or other messages sent to Neal Aronson, managing partner and founder of Roark Capital. Aronson is the controlling owner of Roark, regulatory filings show, which has $18.6 billion in assets under management. Through a spokeswoman, Aronson declined to comment. In January, after Roberts had collected 7,800 signatures on a petition asking Roark to change its policy, the company allowed tips on credit card orders placed through its app. An improvement, Roberts acknowledged, but such orders are a small percentage of those made via credit cards, she pointed out. The Inspire Brands spokesman said barring tips on credit cards \u201cis a technology limitation that we inherited when we purchased the brand\u201d in 2018. \u201cWe are now working on implementing the credit card tipping capability,\u201d he said. Inspire Brands has also worked to battle the Raise the Wage Act, which has been introduced in Congress every year since 2017 and would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour among workers like Roberts. In March, Inspire sent a memo to franchise owners highlighting its lobbying success in opposing the change. Describing its efforts, Inspire said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you\u2019re on the menu, and you can guarantee your opponents are eating!\u201d Chris Fuller, a spokesman for Inspire Brands, said the company fought the national minimum wage legislation because \u201cwe don\u2019t support a one-size-fits-all approach to the minimum wage. We believe in letting the local markets dictate.\u201d He added: \u201cMore than 90 percent of our team members at corporate-owned restaurants are above the state or local minimum wage.\u201d Some Inspire Brands workers have taken matters into their own hands. This summer, Matthew Honeycutt, 18, was working at an Arby\u2019s in Charlotte, North Carolina, making $9.50 an hour as a shift manager. He supports an 8-month-old son. On July 20, he and a group of workers walked off the job seeking a pay raise, forcing managers to close the Arby\u2019s store two hours early, Honeycutt said. That got management\u2019s attention, he said. \u201cThe strike was on a Tuesday, and it was about Thursday when he started getting the raises out,\u201d Honeycutt said of his boss, who gave him a 50-cents-an-hour raise. \"Every kind of worker you can think of is working so hard, but they're not getting paid what they\u2019re worth.\" Honeycutt\u2019s boss did not respond to a voicemail message seeking comment. In mid-September, Honeycutt quit his job at Arby's for a higher-paying position elsewhere. While Inspire Brands fights against a higher minimum wage, some other restaurant companies owned by publicly traded companies are taking a different approach. They say increasing worker pay is good for business. In February, Robert Verostek, the chief financial officer of restaurant chain Denny\u2019s, told investors that paying a higher wage to its workers in California had resulted in \u201cnot just positive sales, but positive guest traffic.\u201d And in May, McDonald's began increasing pay by 10 percent for almost 37,000 workers in company-owned stores. Shift managers like Honeycutt, who earned $10 at Arby\u2019s, are earning between $15 and $20 an hour depending on the location, McDonald\u2019s said. Sean Dunlop, an equity analyst at Morningstar Research, said Inspire Brands is a well-managed company. But increasing pay and benefits among workers is an industry trend it won't be able to resist. \"As you\u2019re thinking about bigger chains, not only are they making a broader push to a $15 average wage at restaurants, you\u2019ve also seen them offer tuition assistance, paid time off, retention bonuses and referral bonuses as they\u2019ve been trying to attract workers,\" Dunlop said. \"Inspire Brands, if they want to compete, are going to be forced to raise wages. They're going to have to, whether they want to or not.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/silicon-valley-area-food-banks-strain-under-growing-logistical-needs-n1281047", "title": "Silicon Valley area food banks strain under growing logistical needs of poverty", "subtitle": "\u201cInfrastructure requirements have sorely taxed the charitable food system at a time when demand is still extraordinarily high,\u201d one expert said.", "author": "By Cyrus Farivar", "section": null, "body": "RICHMOND, Calif. \u2014 On a recent unseasonably warm October day, dozens of Californians gathered at a food distribution site on a vast, unshaded blacktop space behind an elementary school. In one hour, 193 people waited patiently to fill their carts and shopping bags with produce like bell peppers, apples, onions and squash from the side of a massive truck. \u201cThat\u2019s a record for this year,\u201d said Matthew Durkin, 30, the mobile distribution supervisor, while nodding at the clients and noting that he usually sees only about 160 people. \u201cIt means there\u2019s an increased need.\u201d Durkin, of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, says that while demand for free food has slowed slightly from the start of the pandemic, people are still hungry. \u201cWe have seen another jump in numbers within the last few months. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, adding that many clients have told them how much they fear returning to work. \"They are concerned about Covid-19 surges, as so many of us are, and some of them may need to stay available for unexpected changes in child care and school due to Covid exposures or cases.\u201d More than 18 months into the pandemic, San Francisco Bay Area nonprofit organizations, from food banks to shelters for domestic violence victims, say that they are seeing more demand for their services than they ever saw before the pandemic. Even now, there are still two members of the California National Guard working at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties\u2019 central warehouse in Fairfield. As the pandemic drags on, these support facilities are also struggling with supply chain problems to meet the seemingly endless demand. It presents even more challenges as supplies and workers grow more scarce. Joel Sjostrom, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, has watched the food bank\u2019s demand grow to 300,000 people at the height of the pandemic from 178,000 before the pandemic began. He is now still trying to find support for 240,000 clients each month. Almost immediately after the March 2020 shelter-in-place order was instituted, he said, his organization lost 35 percent of its volunteer workforce because it depends so heavily on older volunteers who were scared to work before they were vaccinated. He had to call in members of the California National Guard, two of which remain. \u201cTo meet those volume increases, we have had to step up facilities and transportation,\u201d Sjostrom added. \u201cI had heard of the National Guard being helpful to others in Southern California.\u201d At one point, there were as many as 25 soldiers working to help this one bank. In California, the National Guard, as of Thursday, still had 140 soldiers deployed to food banks across 16 counties, down from a high of 767 in April 2020, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan M. Shiroma, a California National Guard spokesperson. But the National Guard is gradually trying to cut those numbers back and deploy these workers to other missions. In addition to help from the National Guard, Sjostrom has hired more full-time staff. But even now, even with 16 drivers, he still would like four more \u201cClass A\u201d drivers who can operate big rig trucks. In order to stay competitive with other outfits that employ drivers, he said he has had to raise his rates from $28 per hour to $30 per hour. \u201cIt\u2019s truly market pressure,\u201d Sjostrom said. \u201cAmazon has ads out, as does Hello Fresh, and driver demand is everywhere.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/traffic-stops-are-flashpoint-policing-america-reformers-are-winning-big-n1280594", "title": "Police face a 'crisis of trust' with Black motorists.

Police chiefs aren't happy.", "author": "By Simone Weichselbaum, Emily R. Siegel and Andrew Blankstein", "section": null, "body": "In the months after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, public defenders in Virginia saw an opportunity to overhaul policing in the state. Among their key priorities to address racial disparities: a ban on traffic stops for such infractions as broken taillights, tinted windows and the aroma of marijuana. What happened next stunned police officials across Virginia. In just three months, the ban the public defenders pitched to Democratic legislators sailed to the governor\u2019s desk and was signed into law. With Covid-19 shutting down the state Capitol and forcing the legislative sessions to take place via Zoom, the law enforcement officials who objected to the bill had failed to galvanize the opposition. In March, Virginia became the first state to prohibit the kind of low-level traffic stops that disproportionately affect people of color and are often used as pretexts to search for drugs and weapons. An NBC News analysis of the early data shows that the measure is having an impact on the percentage of Black motorists searched by police during traffic stops. \u201cAs public defenders, we aren\u2019t exactly used to winning, let alone winning big,\u201d said Brad Haywood, the chief public defender for Arlington County and executive director of Justice Forward, a criminal justice reform organization made up of public defenders across the state. \u201cThis will dramatically reduce race-based policing and impact so many lives.\u201d Long a cornerstone of American law enforcement, the traffic stop has emerged as a flashpoint in the debate over police reform. Over the last 20 months, district attorneys in California and Minnesota have ordered prosecutors to drop cases in which officers found guns or drugs during traffic stops for minor infractions. Other states, including Washington and Massachusetts, are considering restrictions similar to Virginia\u2019s. Proponents describe the measures as a long overdue step in banishing a tactic that targets mainly Black drivers and fails to improve public safety. But many law enforcement officials argue that they\u2019re being stripped of a crucial tool that they say helps to reduce vehicle deaths and remove criminals, guns and drugs from the streets, although the police chiefs and sheriffs interviewed for this article struggled to provide data backing up their case. Maggie DeBoard, the chief of the Herndon Police Department in Virginia, said stripping police of the ability to make certain traffic stops will make the roads more susceptible to traffic accidents and create fewer opportunities for officers to encounter people who should be off the streets. \u201cWe are eliminating more and more interactions with criminals by not allowing us to enforce the laws that are on the books,\u201d said DeBoard, who was the president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police as the group fought the bill. \u201cA lot of times you stop a vehicle, you have no idea the race, color, creed, religion of the person you're stopping,\u201d DeBoard said. \u201cYou see a violation, you stop the car. And at night, you definitely don\u2019t know who you\u2019re stopping. So it is not about targeting.\u201d Virginia started collecting detailed traffic stop statistics only in June 2020. The early data suggest that the law is having some effect on how the roads are policed. In the first four months after the law was enacted \u2014 March to June \u2014 the number of overall traffic stops rose by 7 percent compared to the previous four months, which experts said isn\u2019t surprising given that warmer weather tends to attract more drivers to the roads. But the number of motorists subjected to searches after having been pulled over \u2014 the category that the reformers care about most \u2014 dropped sharply, according to an NBC News analysis of police data obtained in a public records request. The number of Black drivers who were searched fell by 40 percent, and the number of white drivers dropped by 30 percent, the data show. Black people still accounted for about 30 percent of all traffic stops \u2014 the same percentage as before the law was changed \u2014 even though they are about 20 percent of the population of Virginia. White people, who make up 65 percent of the population, accounted for slightly under 65 percent of the stops before and after the law was changed, the early data show. Da\u2019Quan Marcell Love, the executive director of the Virginia NAACP, said the decline in the number of searches of Black drivers shows that the reforms are broadly working. But he said advocates are waiting to see how the situation plays out in the long term. \u201cWe have to give it time to work,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe are not launching a celebration any time soon.\u201d Officers stop about 20 million drivers a year, according to federal estimates, for reasons from speeding to blowing through reds light to expired tags. The vast majority of the encounters last only a few minutes and result in tickets or warnings, research shows. Police across the country have long been criticized for using minor infractions such as broken taillights as reasons to stop motorists and investigate them for possible crimes. Criminologists and civil rights lawyers have panned the tactic as a fishing expedition rife with racial bias that yields few results. Frank Baumgartner, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed more than 24 million traffic stops across North Carolina from 2002 to 2020. He found that the encounters led to arrests about 2 percent of the time. Searches also rarely occurred, and when they did, weapons were discovered in one-tenth of 1 percent of incidents. Black people were the subjects of nearly half the stops, Baumgartner found, even though they are only 21 percent of the state\u2019s population. \u201cFor every one bad guy they catch, they alienate, like, 18 young Black men,\u201d Baumgartner said. \u201cThat's where we get to the crisis of trust with the police.\u201d That type of traffic stop led to two of the highest-profile police killings in recent years: those of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Both were Black men who were shot and killed by officers after having been pulled over for broken taillights. Officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder of Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked coast-to-coast calls for reform. Faced with overwhelming public pressure, elected officials are increasingly moving forward with measures to strip away police powers regardless of whether law enforcement leaders support them. Last month, the top prosecutor in Ramsey County, Minnesota, where Castile was killed, announced that he would no longer prosecute  most cases that stem from non-public-safety traffic stops, such as expired tags. He cited the disproportionate impact on people of color, especially Black people, among other reasons. \u201cThe outcome of these stops is that it yields very, very little contraband,\u201d said the prosecutor, County Attorney John Choi. \u201cIf I thought that this would lead to more problems from a public safety perspective, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Larger police departments in Choi\u2019s county supported the move, but the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association described it as \u201cinsulting.\u201d More statewide bans may be on the horizon as politicians continue to openly shrug off opposition from police. Inspired by the change in Virginia\u2019s law, Joe Nguyen, a Democratic state senator in Washington, recently introduced legislation that would prohibit police from pulling motorists over for failing to stop, driving without licenses and other violations. \u201cWe passed a few bills last year that didn\u2019t have law enforcement support, so it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of,\u201d Nguyen said. Some police chiefs across the country, in places like Oakland, California; Minneapolis; and Portland, Oregon, have retooled their traffic enforcement policies to avoid unnecessary confrontations with drivers. The Oakland Police Department issued a directive five years ago discouraging officers from pulling people over for low-level offenses like equipment violations and expired registrations. Since the policies were put in place, the percentage of Black drivers who were stopped fell from 62 percent in 2016 to 51 percent in 2019. The police department enlisted Stanford University to examine its data, which showed that under 3 percent of stops in 2013 and 2014 were linked to more serious crimes. Deputy Police Chief Christopher Bolton urged Oakland police brass reluctant to reform to take a hard look at the statistics. \u201cWhy are we continuing to do those stops when the data is showing that not only is it not effective and efficient, but it could very well be damaging public trust and confidence in what our strategies are?\u201d Bolton asked. But in San Francisco, District Attorney Chesa Boudin\u2019s push to end \u201cpretextual\u201d traffic stops has met fierce resistance from the police. During his second month in office, Boudin told staff members to refrain from prosecuting people who were stopped for minor infractions and found to have \u201ccontraband,\u201d including drugs and guns. Union officials slammed Boudin for creating an environment in which criminals feel comfortable to break the law without fear of punishment. \u201cIf they want to continue to handcuff the police in doing their jobs, the unintended consequences are going to be more crime victims,\u201d said Tony Montoya, the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Union officials blame Boudin\u2019s new traffic policy for the release of a man who was accused of fatally shooting two people weeks after he was pulled over and found with an assault-style rifle without a serial number. The district attorney\u2019s office said its decision not to pursue charges against the suspect, Robert Newt, had nothing to do with the circumstances of the stop. The investigators didn\u2019t provide DNA or fingerprints that could tie Newt to the gun, Boudin\u2019s office said. Rachel Marshall, a spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office, said the policy \u201coffers room for exceptions.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office said it has rejected about one to two cases a month because of Boudin\u2019s rules, for a total of 11 this year. \u201cRacial profiling undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and fosters distrust in communities of color \u2014 all of which decreases public safety,\u201d Marshall said. Police chiefs and sheriffs in Virginia say that the state\u2019s ban went too far and that it is putting lives at risk at a time when murders and fatal accidents are already soaring. The original bill, in fact, would have gone even further by blocking police from stopping vehicles with no front lights. The governor\u2019s office cut the measure after Chesterfield County Police Chief Jeffrey Katz blasted it in a viral Facebook post. The new law permits a driver to have one broken headlight. \u201cLawmakers were making decisions based on the loudest voices in the room, but not necessarily the most informed voices in the room,\u201d Katz said in an interview. \u201cAnd all you have to do is look at the crime rate in the last year and a half.\u201d As in many other states, the number of murders in Virginia has risen sharply since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Virginia State Police. Even though officers can still cite people for speeding and erratic driving, rural county sheriffs said the ban creates an atmosphere in which reckless motorists feel safe to break the law, and they warned that traffic deaths will rise. Fatal traffic accidents in the six months after the law was changed hit a 10-year high, according to an NBC News analysis that compared them to the same period going back to 2011. Jessica Cowardin, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said the rise in traffic deaths mirrors national figures, which are also up. Federal officials blame the increase on speeding, drunk drivers and people who don\u2019t wear seat belts \u2014 violations that police in Virginia can still enforce. For some Virginia police chiefs, the concerns go beyond traffic accidents. In Petersburg, about 20 miles south of Richmond, officers confiscated more than 1,000 guns in the three years leading up to the ban, often in vehicle stops, Police Chief Travis Christian said. But his office was unable to provide data backing up the claim. The analysis of arrest data found that weapons were discovered in about 7 percent of traffic stops in Petersburg from 2018 to 2020. As a chief who is Black, Christian said he is \u201ctorn\u201d over the new law. He acknowledged that Black Virginians feel targeted by police when they are behind the wheel, but he said he still wants the ban reversed. \u201cIt has given us the ability to use it as an investigative tool to get to other crimes that have been committed,\u201d Christian said. \u201cThat tool has been eliminated for us.\u201d David Weisburd, a criminology professor and the executive director of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, said he wasn\u2019t aware of any data that support the claim that low-level traffic stops help to reduce crime. \u201cIt is time, in my view, for the police to bring evidence to their arguments,\u201d Weisburd said. \u201cThat evidence could help in deciding what is reasonable or unreasonable or what is good policing from what is awful policing.\u201d The new law hasn\u2019t put an end to controversial stops in Virginia. Five days after the ban went into effect, state troopers pulled over Juanisha Brooks, 35, a Black woman who is a senior video producer for the Defense Department, as she was driving along a highway in Northern Virginia. A trooper ordered her to get out of the vehicle several times, saying he wanted to show her what was wrong with her car. Brooks refused, saying she didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t tell her while she remained in the vehicle. Dashcam video appears to show the trooper dragging Brooks out of the seat and pushing her up against her car. Officers charged her with reckless driving, eluding, obstruction of justice and failing to have her headlights on. Prosecutors dropped the case, noting that the stop was illegal because of the reforms. Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, insisted that the arrest was fair because Brooks refused to comply with the trooper\u2019s commands. State Police conducted an internal investigation; Geller said she couldn\u2019t share whether the trooper was disciplined because of privacy rules. \u201cI was afraid for my life,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be another hashtag.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ems-services-warn-crippling-labor-shortage-undermining-911-system-rcna2677", "title": "EMS services warn of 'crippling labor shortage' undermining 911 system", "subtitle": "\u201cWe\u2019re not bleeding any longer \u2014 we\u2019re hemorrhaging,\u201d one ambulance service operator said of a decadelong worker shortage exacerbated by the pandemic.", "author": "By Phil McCausland", "section": null, "body": "The pandemic-induced shortage of emergency medical technicians and paramedics nationwide is so dire that ambulance service providers warn of sharp cuts to services and longer waits for 911 calls \u2014 even when it\u2019s a matter of life or death. Companies have had to close, consolidate or come up with new strategies to answer calls, said American Ambulance Association President Shawn Baird, who added that there is simply not enough EMS personnel to cover calls in many parts of the country, especially during the pandemic. The loss of staff to pandemic-related burnout and low wages has created a vicious cycle, requiring greater dependence on those workers who have stayed on. The situation has deteriorated to such a degree in recent months that ambulance services and industry leaders are pleading with Congress and state legislatures to help. \"The magnitude has really blown up over the last few months,\" Baird said. \"When you take a system that was already fragile and stretched it, because you didn't have enough people entering the field, then you throw a public health emergency and all of the additional burdens that it put on our workforce as well as the labor shortages across the entire economy, and it really has put us in a crisis mode.\" It's a crisis that has made it difficult to hire and even harder to retain EMTs and paramedics, according to a AAA survey of 258 EMS organizations across the country. In 2020, nearly a third of the workforce left their ambulance company after less than a year, the survey said. Eleven percent left within the first three months. \"It's almost unmanageable,\" said Ken Cummings, who leads Tri-Hospital EMS in Port Huron, Michigan. \"I don't think any EMS provider wants to go out in public and say that your service might be interrupted, but the reality is that because of the extremely low workforce situation right now, we are going to start to see delays. We're already seeing that throughout the country right now.\" Cummings said he currently has 10 openings, about 10 percent of his workforce. He's currently paying double overtime to fill the gap left by those empty positions, but that has increased the average work week of his paramedics by at least eight hours. The amount of money he's paying in overtime is also becoming untenable, and his workers are losing interest in the extra cash. \"We're spending money today that we're hoping we get tomorrow, to be real honest with you,\" he said. \"It's not a long-term solution.\" There are an estimated 1,000 open EMS positions in Michigan alone, Cummings said. The good news for Cummings is that he has a handful of students who will graduate next year from the paramedic program, but the churn is constant. The Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, also agreed to allocate $12.9 million of the state's budget to increase reimbursement rates. But that has not slowed the revolving-door nature of the job. Among full-time EMTs, 47 percent reported in 2020 that the reason for leaving was for a career or occupation change, according to the survey. That number is 45 percent among paramedics. \"In my experience running an EMS service, I've seen more than a few employees get into the industry and leave within six months,\" said Judd Smith, the program director of Texas EMS School in Abilene. \"I'll see people work for three weeks and then move on to the next thing.\" The decline in Texas has been particularly substantial. By mid-August, only 27 percent of licensed EMS professionals had submitted a patient care record, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, meaning that over 70 percent of licensed Texas EMTs did not work on an ambulance in the first eight months of the year. That represents a significant drop from the 43 percent of EMTs who submitted reports in 2020 and the 45 percent who did in 2019. The circumstances have pushed the American Ambulance Association and National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians to send a letter to Congress last week pushing for a hearing to address the shortfall and asking for more funding to increase wages. The letter warned that \"our nation\u2019s EMS system is facing a crippling workforce shortage, a long-term problem that has been building for more than a decade. It threatens to undermine our emergency 9-1-1 infrastructure and deserves urgent attention by the Congress.\" The pandemic has made a bad labor problem worse. The spread of the virus, the frequency of calls, worry of potential infection and the necessary safeguards that emergency personnel must take to protect themselves have created additional stress that has caused many to leave the field, providers said. Their departure has then increased the need for those who remain to work overtime, pushing even more to leave the field. The nationwide health emergency also caused many EMT and paramedic courses to shut down, meaning there is a dearth of students coming into the industry. \"We're not bleeding any longer \u2014 we're hemorrhaging,\" said Gary Wadaga, who operates Bay Ambulance in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Ambulance companies have faced years of workforce challenges that has damaged their ability to respond to calls quickly, but the situation is getting worse. Last year, because an ambulance service closed south of his company's service area, Wadaga had to take on an additional 100 square miles of territory. Now he covers 1,500 square miles and receives about 1,000 calls a year with six paramedic positions. The trouble is, he's been unable to fill two spots and has another two workers on leave, leaving him and one other person to respond to every emergency call that comes in. \"I've not seen it this bad in 41 years, and you can't just set that aside,\" said Wadaga, adding that the increasing demands of the job have caused him great anxiety. \"You want to be there for your community, but the fact that one day we're not going to have enough people absolutely bothers me.\" Ambulance companies once had the luxury of considering applicants, but that appears to be a concept of the past. Now companies are actively recruiting and even going after one another's employees because the pool of eligible workers is so small. \"Overall, it's robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Baird, \"because every community needs these folks.\" Wadaga and other ambulance service operators said the pandemic has increased the viciousness of a labor shortage and put the nation's emergency medical system at risk of a \"death spiral\" that could be difficult to pull out of. The salary requests of a shrinking workforce are getting higher as wages remain stagnant. The 2020 median pay for EMTs and paramedics was $36,650 per year or $17.62 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about a 7.5 percent increase since 2011. Advocates said the wages don't match the requirements of the job anymore. \"When you're an EMS provider putting your life on the line and entering into a closed environments with infectious patients and you can make more money to work in an Amazon warehouse, it becomes really difficult to retain people,\" said Robert Luckritz, who serves as chair of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians' EMS Workforce Committee. But it's not just retail and warehouse work that's calling. Luckritz said that hospitals facing their own nursing and health care worker shortages are at times actively recruiting EMT and paramedics, promising higher wages, better hours and increased benefits. That's an issue Luckritz and his colleagues are attempting to work on, but it's a challenge. They need more money to hire more people, but ambulance company rates are set by insurance providers and the government when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, which both contribute to the vast majority of calls, Luckritz said. \"Unlike much of the other industries across the country ... we're not able to raise our prices \u2014 our prices are set by the government,\" he said. \"So with reimbursement not keeping up with our costs, it makes it very difficult for us to compete for the workforce.\" The fear is that if the country doesn't face these problems now, they will be unfixable down the line. Baird, the AAA president, said that if things spiral too far down, \"we can\u2019t get people to even enter the field because it looks too daunting.\" \"We have to turn this around,\" he said. One silver lining is that online EMS programs, such as Smith's Texas EMS School, are seeing increased interest \u2014 even as nationwide there is a decline in enrollment in traditional programs. The number of applications for their EMT program, which can be completed in 10 to 18 weeks via a mix of online coursework and hands-on clinical and field experience, jumped from 495 applicants in 2019 to 1,469 in 2021. The jobs certainly are there waiting for them at graduation. \"I don't know of any one of our students that doesn't get hired within the first week of getting licensed,\" Smith said. \"We've even had a big number of them get hired before they even received their certification, so they start working as soon as they're done.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-stake-2022-hopes-child-cash-benefits-there-s-just-n1281142", "title": "Democrats stake 2022 hopes on child cash benefits.

With Republicans opposed, the only realistic vehicle to extend them is Biden\u2019s multitrillion-dollar bill, which Democratic leaders are working feverishly to craft. Allowing the payments to expire would risk erasing the economic gains and leaving struggling parents who have come to rely on it in the lurch. Democratic operatives warn it could turn a significant political asset into a liability just months before an election in which Republicans are historically favored to make gains. \u201cLetting the extremely popular child care tax credit expire would be exactly the type of mistake we can\u2019t afford,\u201d Tyler Law, a Democratic consultant who worked for the party\u2019s House election arm during the 2018 blue wave, said. \u201cDemocrats need to deliver win after win after win to show voters we can govern and deserve to stay in power,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet for success, but there\u2019s certainly a recipe for disaster: failing to pass the Biden agenda.\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the child tax credit has had a major impact in alleviating poverty and held it up as an example that says Democrats, when in charge, can help Americans. \u201cThe idea of letting it expire, I think, would be horrific,\u201d he said. While Democrats battle over what provisions make it into the bill, they appear to agree unanimously that the money for kids should be extended \u2014 from centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., to progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. But the details are unclear. The House version of the bill extends the payments through 2025. That may be adjusted as lawmakers sort out how to cut down the plan's price tag to get the centrists on board. And the income threshold for who is eligible may be adjusted as Manchin has demanded additional means-testing for the various programs in the bill. \u201cThere's some differences of opinion about how to do it, and how long to fund it, etcetera. And it has to fit within the overall top line of the bill,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. \u201cBut every Dem really wants it to happen.\u201d Republicans are adamantly opposed to the program and say it should expire. \u201cThe federal government shouldn't be in the business of just handing out money because you have kids,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said. \u201cThat's ridiculous.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Democrats of \u201ctrying to build a permanent welfare class in the country,\u201d saying the child tax credit includes \u201cdistributing more borrowed money to people who don't have a need for it.\u201d Some Democrats are spoiling for that fight. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the party\u2019s House campaign arm, projected confidence that Democrats will pass the bill, extend the child cash payments and then run on them. \u201cWe're going to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact that the Republicans have opposed it at every step of the way will come back to haunt them. I believe that it's exactly that type of thing that is the anvil on which we will hammer them in 2022.\u201d Sean McElwee, a progressive pollster who has been cited by the White House, said his firm has found that voters who received the child cash payment approve of Biden's job performance by a wide margin of 66 percent to 32 percent, whereas voters who haven't gotten it split evenly with 49 percent approving and disapproving. The firm, Data for Progress, found that those who voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020 and who receive the child tax credit register 79 percent disapproval of Biden, whereas 92 percent of those who do not receive it disapprove of the president. \u201cEnding the child tax credit would risk washing away these key persuasion gains that will be necessary to win in 2022 and 2024,\u201d McElwee said. Overall, the child cash payments are supported by 59 percent of U.S. adults, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. That includes 75 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of Republicans. Some of the states with the highest average per-month cash payments are conservative states. Progressives cite the program as an example of how government can make Americans' lives better. \u201cWe already have powerful data showing us that this tax credit is reducing hunger in America. It's providing school shoes and backpacks for kids to be able to go back to school,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u201cWe need to protect this \u2014 not just because it expires in an election year. We need to protect it because this helps American families.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/squid-game-entertaining-world-there-s-different-feeling-south-korea-n1281119", "title": "'Squid Game' is entertaining the world. But there's a different feeling in South Korea", "subtitle": "\u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing,\" said Professor CedarBough Saeji.", "author": "By Jennifer Jett and Stella Kim", "section": null, "body": "HONG KONG \u2014 Why are South Koreans watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d? Because everyone else is. The nine-episode horror series on Netflix has hit No. 1 in 90 of the streaming service\u2019s markets around the world, including South Korea, where it was made. \u201cI got to the point where I could not hold a conversation without watching the show,\u201d said Jung Dunn, a security analyst in Seoul, the South Korean capital. But the show also strikes a nerve because it unflinchingly addresses a problem that is particularly entrenched in South Korea: debt and the never-ending struggle to pay it off. The cast of \u201cSquid Game\u201d features some of South Korea\u2019s biggest stars, including Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist, Seong Gi-hun, a hopelessly indebted father who receives a business card from a stranger offering him a way out. Along with 455 other contestants \u2014 from all walks of life but all deeply in debt too \u2014 he agrees to compete for a cash prize of 45.6 billion won (about $38 million) by playing a series of traditional Korean children\u2019s games, only to discover that elimination from each round means death. \u201cThere\u2019s this dissonance between Korean pride that this Korean show is dominating Netflix all around the world, and the discomfort with what the show appears to expose about Korea,\u201d said CedarBough Saeji, an assistant professor of Korean and East Asian studies at Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea. \u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing.\u201d That South Korea also produced \u201cParasite,\u201d the 2020 Oscar winner for best picture that also focused on themes of inequality, has probably accentuated this discomfort, Saeji said. Still, \u201cSquid Game\u201d is wildly popular in its home country. The show was released on Sept. 17 just before Chuseok, a Korean holiday similar to Thanksgiving when families gather, the perfect time for binge-watching. The surge in network traffic led one internet service provider to sue Netflix to cover its costs. The fervor has also spilled over into real life. A street vendor in Seoul who provided the makers of \u201cSquid Game\u201d with dalgona, a brittle sugar candy at the center of one of the games, told Reuters that he had seen a boom in business. Thousands of curious South Koreans also tried the eight-digit phone number that appears on the business card, which the show\u2019s makers didn\u2019t realize would reach an actual person. The owner of the number, and even people with similar numbers, have been inundated with calls and messages at all hours. On Wednesday, Netflix said it was working with the show\u2019s local production company to address the issue, including editing scenes to remove the number. Park Sae-ha, a senior studying economics at Yonsei University in Seoul, said \u201cSquid Game\u201d was \u201cspell-binding because it was so explicit and blunt.\u201d \u201cAlthough I am young, I could easily relate to the hard reality of a very competitive society,\u201d she said. That intense competitiveness may be one reason South Korea has been so successful, with a period of rapid industrialization starting in the 1960s that turned it into the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. But as in many other countries, a university degree and a white-collar job don\u2019t guarantee the financial security they used to, Saeji said. With an average income of about $42,000 a year, many Koreans now find they have to borrow to keep up. Fueled by low interest rates, household debt in South Korea has grown significantly in recent years, and is now equal to the country\u2019s annual GDP. (In the U.S., by contrast, household debt is about 80 percent of GDP.) People may rack up debt because of credit card spending, unemployment or gambling losses, but a large chunk of it is tied to real estate. Housing prices have been rising fast, especially under President Moon Jae-in, and the average price of an apartment in Seoul is nearing $1 million. Lending curbs and efforts to cool the housing market have done little to rein in household borrowing. In addition to housing, some Koreans, especially young people, borrow money to invest in cryptocurrency. Many Koreans start out by borrowing from legitimate financial institutions like banks, said Koo Se-Woong, a commentator on Korean culture based in Germany. When that avenue is exhausted, they may move on to second-tier lenders that charge higher interest. In the worst-case scenarios, he said, borrowers turn to loan shark operations that can charge triple-digit interest rates, \u201cand then you are pushed into situations from which you really cannot get out.\u201d According to some estimates, there are 400,000 Koreans in debt to loan sharks. \u201cWhen you look at the characters in the show who are participating in this game, they represent that demographic of the Koreans who are in the worst possible situation because of their personal debt,\u201d Koo said. In a recent widely shared Facebook post, Koo said he was shocked when a friend told him he was living paycheck to paycheck, despite having a good job. The friend \u201cdoesn't strike anyone as extravagant,\u201d Koo said, but struggles to afford the trappings of middle-class life: an apartment, a car and occasional travel with his wife and children. \"It's all paid for by loans, I am telling you,\" Koo said his friend told him. \"We just have no money.\" Jung, the security analyst, said the plot of \u201cSquid Game\u201d was easy to accept because \u201cit dealt with such familiar stories of debt-ridden people you come across in real life.\u201d \u201cThe story stems from a deeply rooted perception of how society looks at failure, especially individual financial failure,\u201d he said. Bankruptcy in South Korea is generally seen not as a chance to start over but as a devastating fate. That is underlined in \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Saeji said, when contestants are given the option to leave but choose to keep playing even at the risk of their lives. \u201cIn the regular world it\u2019s not just the death of their body, it\u2019s the death of their pride. It\u2019s the shame of having to be such an unsuccessful person in front of your family,\u201d she said. Viewers in South Korea say the show is all the more disturbing because it injects death and violence into playground games like Red Light, Green Light and tug of war. The show plays on childhood nostalgia \u201cand along with it the innocent times when you had no problems,\u201d said Kim Hern-sik, a pop culture critic in Seoul. \u201cYet the story tells you that escaping from reality is not the answer.\u201d \u201cSquid Game\u201d is \u201cfundamentally a Korean story, featuring games people would remember playing as kids,\u201d Don Kang, vice president of Korean content at Netflix, told NBC News in an email. \u201cSo we knew it would resonate with our members here.\u201d Its popularity in the West came as more of a surprise. But Korean cultural exports have been sweeping Asia for years, and Netflix was already betting on their growing appeal. The company is spending $500 million this year on Korean content, almost as much as it spent in the last five years. Saeji said that after decades of Western cultural influence, the success of \u201cSquid Game\u201d shows that South Korea can make a TV show with a Hollywood feel \u201cand they can do it better.\u201d While \u201cSquid Game\u201d is not the first story about a fight to the death, director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who has a film degree from the University of Southern California, made it influential in his own way, said Oh Dong-jin, a prominent film critic in South Korea. \u201cEvery movie borrows this and that from other movies. What matters, therefore, is how creatively you can borrow from different references,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, even from this standpoint, the traditional children\u2019s games the show uses make 'Squid Game' quite original.\u201d Margie Kim, a housewife in Seoul who is watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d with her family, said that while she enjoyed its intensity and pop-art-influenced visuals, the underlying messages were also important. \u201cI do feel the pain of what our society is going through,\u201d she said. The show deals with so many pressing issues, she said\u2014income inequality, youth unemployment, a rapidly aging society\u2014that it\u2019s something her entire family can relate to and talk about. \u201cSo many middle-class, ordinary people live with so much debt,\u201d she said. \u201cI could totally empathize with people who joined the game.\u201d Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Stella Kim reported from Los Angeles.", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/working-companies-owned-well-heeled-private-equity-firms-can-mean-n1281146", "title": "Working for companies owned by well-heeled private-equity firms can mean lower wages for employees", "subtitle": "Workers at some fast-food chains owned by public firms are getting better wages now. It\u2019s a different story at restaurants owned by private-equity firms.", "author": "By Gretchen Morgenson", "section": null, "body": "Alma Jordan, a certified nursing assistant at the Marcella Center nursing home in Burlington, New Jersey, respected the residents she cared for there over the past 16 years. They were like family, she said, and she believes they\u2019ve appreciated her attentiveness, especially during Covid-19. Not so, the nursing home\u2019s new owner, Jordan said. After Complete Care Management, the largest for-profit nursing home operator in New Jersey, took over the 150-bed Marcella Center in April, it slashed worker benefits, she and other employees as well as a representative from their union told NBC News. Amid the pandemic, Jordan\u2019s paid holidays were reduced, and her monthly health insurance costs more than tripled, she said. The company stopped contributing to the employee pension, replacing it with a 401(k) plan that had no employer match or contribution. Complete Care took away vision insurance and stopped a reimbursement program covering employee education costs, so Jordan, 45, won\u2019t be able to recoup money she spent working toward a degree to become a licensed practical nurse. \u201cI put all my effort into this company, and someone else took over and they don\u2019t want to give us what we deserve,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s business. It\u2019s not about the staff and the residents. It\u2019s only about making profits.\u201d In late September, Jordan quit her position at the facility. The reduced benefits and deteriorating work conditions got to be too much, she said. When Complete Care came in, Jordan and other Marcella workers were operating under a union contract struck with the facility\u2019s previous owner. Complete Care did away with that contract, which also covered four other unionized New Jersey nursing facilities it recently acquired, according to the Service Employees International Union. Complete Care owns 61 facilities in eight states, including Connecticut, Maryland and Wisconsin. It is backed by a private-equity firm called Peace Capital in Lakewood, New Jersey, whose principal owner is Sam Stein. Jordan and her fellow workers are not alone in experiencing reduced circumstances after their company is taken over by a private-equity firm. The new titans of finance, these firms use large pools of debt \u2014 typically raised in what's called the leveraged loan market \u2014 to acquire companies they hope to resell in a few years at a profit. Among companies raising money in this loan market during the past three years, debt levels at private-equity-backed entities were at least 30 percent higher than debt levels at companies not backed by private equity, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. But the heavy debt loads they take on, combined with pressure to flip acquired companies quickly, increases the likelihood that private-equity firms will have to cut costs in the operations that they buy. Often, the first to the chopping block is the company\u2019s workforce. A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research lays this out. Researchers analyzed almost 10,000 debt-fueled buyouts between 1980 and 2013 and found that employment fell by 13 percent when a private-equity firm took over a public company. Employment declined by even more \u2014 16 percent \u2014 when private equity acquired a unit or division of a company. Eileen Appelbaum is an economist and co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, and co-author of \"Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street.\" Her study of private equity has led her to conclude that the industry\u2019s growing clout is not only a concern for workers, but also has the potential to harm the nation\u2019s broader economy. \u201cYou have a lot more ownership of productive resources by investors who don\u2019t know an industry, don\u2019t understand the value of skilled workers and who are just in it to make their profit and get out,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cThat erodes productivity.\u201d Almost 12 million employees, or roughly 7 percent of the U.S. labor force, work for private-equity-backed businesses, according to the American Investment Council, an industry lobbying group. These companies generated about 6.5 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product last year, the group said. The council said private-equity firms create jobs, support businesses and help provide comfortable retirements for pensioners invested in the strategy. A spokeswoman for Complete Care echoed this view. She said the company is committed to the long-term viability of its facilities, adding in a statement: \u201cWe offer a comprehensive health plan and competitive benefits, and our facilities are known as great places to work.\u201d The company is negotiating a new union contract, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, though, care at the Marcella facility is declining, Jordan said, days after she quit. \u201cWe were very short-staffed,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think the residents pick up on that because it takes longer to answer a call.\u201d In a statement, a spokesperson for Complete Care said, \u201cComplete Care at Marcella consistently maintains state mandated ratios. ... We take whatever measures necessary to ensure that we have proper staffing to meet the needs of those in our care, including bringing in agency staff and offering bonuses as needed.\" Private equity is a sophisticated investment strategy that has grown furiously in recent years. At the end of last year, assets under management at the firms worldwide stood at $5 trillion, up from $1.5 trillion over the past decade, according to Preqin, a financial data provider. The number of funds devoted to these activities has more than doubled during that period, and last year, private-equity firms paid some $600 billion to acquire companies, up from $250 billion 10 years earlier. Private-equity firms began their climb to power in the 1980s; then they were known as leveraged buyout shops, because of the debt they use. The $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988 by private-equity giant Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts brought such deals to center stage. In recent years, as prevailing interest rates collapsed, private-equity operations have been able to take on greater amounts of low-cost debt to make their acquisitions. Through Sept. 27, for example, $472 billion of leveraged loans were issued, up from $237 billion issued during the same period in 2019, according to LCD of S&P Global. Outside investors, such as public pension funds and endowments, pour money into these takeover deals in the hopes of generating high returns. But recently, as the stock market has roared, outsize returns in private equity have all but vanished, academic studies show, and they are now in line with overall market performance. Nevertheless, more companies are owned by private-equity firms now than trade on the nation\u2019s stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, private-equity firms\u2019 rising dominance has generated immense wealth for their executives. The value of Sam Stein's holdings in Complete Care could not be determined and the company declined to provide it, but it is almost certainly dwarfed by those of Stephen Schwarzman, head of Blackstone Group. A close adviser to Donald Trump during his presidency, Schwarzman is worth $35 billion, according to Forbes magazine, up from $15 billion in 2020. Private equity also benefited from recent government interventions related to the Covid pandemic, documents show. At least $5 billion in federal bailout money went to companies backed by large and well-capitalized private-equity firms, according to a recent report from Americans for Financial Reform. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board launched an unprecedented $750 billion program to prop up the corporate bond market, where many of these firms raise money for their buyouts. Among the bonds purchased by the Fed, documents show, were those issued by Blackstone and another private-equity giant, Apollo Global Management, founded by Leon Black. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently testified that the agency would increase its scrutiny on fee disclosures and conflicts of interest among private funds, to ensure their practices don't put investors in these strategies at a disadvantage. And Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a late September memo outlining the agency's priorities that \"the growing role of private equity\" invites an examination of how these firms' business models \"may facilitate unfair methods of competition and consumer protection violations.\" Finally, the Democrats\u2019 proposed tax increase on capital gains may crimp private-equity executives\u2019 earnings. A key reason many of these executives have been able to amass such fortunes is that so much of their earnings are taxed as capital gains with a top rate of 20 percent, not at the higher 37 percent rate that can apply to income. This is a benefit they've tapped for decades, often allowing them to pay a lower tax rate on earnings than a secretary or a teacher might. One of the nation\u2019s biggest private-equity employers is Roark Capital of Atlanta. It owns Inspire Brands \u2014 parent company to an array of fast-food chains that includes Arby\u2019s, Dunkin\u2019, Baskin-Robbins and Sonic \u2014 and other brands such as Cinnabon and Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee. NBC News estimates that more than 700,000 people work at Inspire Brands, many at independently owned franchise stores. Roark is named for the libertarian protagonist in \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d by Ayn Rand, whose life \u201cexemplified the qualities of independence and integrity,\u201d the company\u2019s website said. One of libertarianism's basic tenets is limited government, but three dozen companies owned by Roark obtained $183 million in federal assistance under the CARES Act, according to the Americans for Financial Reform report. Asked whether this acceptance of government funding ran counter to a limited government stance, Roark declined to comment through a spokeswoman. Zella Roberts, a recent graduate of Warren Wilson College near Asheville, North Carolina, worked as a carhop at a Sonic Drive-In earlier this year to help pay tuition. Her all-in pay plummeted during the pandemic, Roberts told NBC News, because customers\u2019 cash usage fell and Sonic did not allow tips on credit cards. Roberts said she and some colleagues sent an email to Roark Capital \"explaining the conditions that Sonic workers experience. The big ask was to put pressure on Sonic corporate to make these changes.\" She said she never heard back about that or other messages sent to Neal Aronson, managing partner and founder of Roark Capital. Aronson is the controlling owner of Roark, regulatory filings show, which has $18.6 billion in assets under management. Through a spokeswoman, Aronson declined to comment. In January, after Roberts had collected 7,800 signatures on a petition asking Roark to change its policy, the company allowed tips on credit card orders placed through its app. An improvement, Roberts acknowledged, but such orders are a small percentage of those made via credit cards, she pointed out. The Inspire Brands spokesman said barring tips on credit cards \u201cis a technology limitation that we inherited when we purchased the brand\u201d in 2018. \u201cWe are now working on implementing the credit card tipping capability,\u201d he said. Inspire Brands has also worked to battle the Raise the Wage Act, which has been introduced in Congress every year since 2017 and would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour among workers like Roberts. In March, Inspire sent a memo to franchise owners highlighting its lobbying success in opposing the change. Describing its efforts, Inspire said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you\u2019re on the menu, and you can guarantee your opponents are eating!\u201d Chris Fuller, a spokesman for Inspire Brands, said the company fought the national minimum wage legislation because \u201cwe don\u2019t support a one-size-fits-all approach to the minimum wage. We believe in letting the local markets dictate.\u201d He added: \u201cMore than 90 percent of our team members at corporate-owned restaurants are above the state or local minimum wage.\u201d Some Inspire Brands workers have taken matters into their own hands. This summer, Matthew Honeycutt, 18, was working at an Arby\u2019s in Charlotte, North Carolina, making $9.50 an hour as a shift manager. He supports an 8-month-old son. On July 20, he and a group of workers walked off the job seeking a pay raise, forcing managers to close the Arby\u2019s store two hours early, Honeycutt said. That got management\u2019s attention, he said. \u201cThe strike was on a Tuesday, and it was about Thursday when he started getting the raises out,\u201d Honeycutt said of his boss, who gave him a 50-cents-an-hour raise. \"Every kind of worker you can think of is working so hard, but they're not getting paid what they\u2019re worth.\" Honeycutt\u2019s boss did not respond to a voicemail message seeking comment. In mid-September, Honeycutt quit his job at Arby's for a higher-paying position elsewhere. While Inspire Brands fights against a higher minimum wage, some other restaurant companies owned by publicly traded companies are taking a different approach. They say increasing worker pay is good for business. In February, Robert Verostek, the chief financial officer of restaurant chain Denny\u2019s, told investors that paying a higher wage to its workers in California had resulted in \u201cnot just positive sales, but positive guest traffic.\u201d And in May, McDonald's began increasing pay by 10 percent for almost 37,000 workers in company-owned stores. Shift managers like Honeycutt, who earned $10 at Arby\u2019s, are earning between $15 and $20 an hour depending on the location, McDonald\u2019s said. Sean Dunlop, an equity analyst at Morningstar Research, said Inspire Brands is a well-managed company. But increasing pay and benefits among workers is an industry trend it won't be able to resist. \"As you\u2019re thinking about bigger chains, not only are they making a broader push to a $15 average wage at restaurants, you\u2019ve also seen them offer tuition assistance, paid time off, retention bonuses and referral bonuses as they\u2019ve been trying to attract workers,\" Dunlop said. \"Inspire Brands, if they want to compete, are going to be forced to raise wages. They're going to have to, whether they want to or not.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/silicon-valley-area-food-banks-strain-under-growing-logistical-needs-n1281047", "title": "Silicon Valley area food banks strain under growing logistical needs of poverty", "subtitle": "\u201cInfrastructure requirements have sorely taxed the charitable food system at a time when demand is still extraordinarily high,\u201d one expert said.", "author": "By Cyrus Farivar", "section": null, "body": "RICHMOND, Calif. \u2014 On a recent unseasonably warm October day, dozens of Californians gathered at a food distribution site on a vast, unshaded blacktop space behind an elementary school. In one hour, 193 people waited patiently to fill their carts and shopping bags with produce like bell peppers, apples, onions and squash from the side of a massive truck. \u201cThat\u2019s a record for this year,\u201d said Matthew Durkin, 30, the mobile distribution supervisor, while nodding at the clients and noting that he usually sees only about 160 people. \u201cIt means there\u2019s an increased need.\u201d Durkin, of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, says that while demand for free food has slowed slightly from the start of the pandemic, people are still hungry. \u201cWe have seen another jump in numbers within the last few months. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, adding that many clients have told them how much they fear returning to work. \"They are concerned about Covid-19 surges, as so many of us are, and some of them may need to stay available for unexpected changes in child care and school due to Covid exposures or cases.\u201d More than 18 months into the pandemic, San Francisco Bay Area nonprofit organizations, from food banks to shelters for domestic violence victims, say that they are seeing more demand for their services than they ever saw before the pandemic. Even now, there are still two members of the California National Guard working at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties\u2019 central warehouse in Fairfield. As the pandemic drags on, these support facilities are also struggling with supply chain problems to meet the seemingly endless demand. It presents even more challenges as supplies and workers grow more scarce. Joel Sjostrom, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, has watched the food bank\u2019s demand grow to 300,000 people at the height of the pandemic from 178,000 before the pandemic began. He is now still trying to find support for 240,000 clients each month. Almost immediately after the March 2020 shelter-in-place order was instituted, he said, his organization lost 35 percent of its volunteer workforce because it depends so heavily on older volunteers who were scared to work before they were vaccinated. He had to call in members of the California National Guard, two of which remain. \u201cTo meet those volume increases, we have had to step up facilities and transportation,\u201d Sjostrom added. \u201cI had heard of the National Guard being helpful to others in Southern California.\u201d At one point, there were as many as 25 soldiers working to help this one bank. In California, the National Guard, as of Thursday, still had 140 soldiers deployed to food banks across 16 counties, down from a high of 767 in April 2020, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan M. Shiroma, a California National Guard spokesperson. But the National Guard is gradually trying to cut those numbers back and deploy these workers to other missions. In addition to help from the National Guard, Sjostrom has hired more full-time staff. But even now, even with 16 drivers, he still would like four more \u201cClass A\u201d drivers who can operate big rig trucks. In order to stay competitive with other outfits that employ drivers, he said he has had to raise his rates from $28 per hour to $30 per hour. \u201cIt\u2019s truly market pressure,\u201d Sjostrom said. \u201cAmazon has ads out, as does Hello Fresh, and driver demand is everywhere.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/traffic-stops-are-flashpoint-policing-america-reformers-are-winning-big-n1280594", "title": "Police face a 'crisis of trust' with Black motorists.

Police chiefs aren't happy.", "author": "By Simone Weichselbaum, Emily R. Siegel and Andrew Blankstein", "section": null, "body": "In the months after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, public defenders in Virginia saw an opportunity to overhaul policing in the state. Among their key priorities to address racial disparities: a ban on traffic stops for such infractions as broken taillights, tinted windows and the aroma of marijuana. What happened next stunned police officials across Virginia. In just three months, the ban the public defenders pitched to Democratic legislators sailed to the governor\u2019s desk and was signed into law. With Covid-19 shutting down the state Capitol and forcing the legislative sessions to take place via Zoom, the law enforcement officials who objected to the bill had failed to galvanize the opposition. In March, Virginia became the first state to prohibit the kind of low-level traffic stops that disproportionately affect people of color and are often used as pretexts to search for drugs and weapons. An NBC News analysis of the early data shows that the measure is having an impact on the percentage of Black motorists searched by police during traffic stops. \u201cAs public defenders, we aren\u2019t exactly used to winning, let alone winning big,\u201d said Brad Haywood, the chief public defender for Arlington County and executive director of Justice Forward, a criminal justice reform organization made up of public defenders across the state. \u201cThis will dramatically reduce race-based policing and impact so many lives.\u201d Long a cornerstone of American law enforcement, the traffic stop has emerged as a flashpoint in the debate over police reform. Over the last 20 months, district attorneys in California and Minnesota have ordered prosecutors to drop cases in which officers found guns or drugs during traffic stops for minor infractions. Other states, including Washington and Massachusetts, are considering restrictions similar to Virginia\u2019s. Proponents describe the measures as a long overdue step in banishing a tactic that targets mainly Black drivers and fails to improve public safety. But many law enforcement officials argue that they\u2019re being stripped of a crucial tool that they say helps to reduce vehicle deaths and remove criminals, guns and drugs from the streets, although the police chiefs and sheriffs interviewed for this article struggled to provide data backing up their case. Maggie DeBoard, the chief of the Herndon Police Department in Virginia, said stripping police of the ability to make certain traffic stops will make the roads more susceptible to traffic accidents and create fewer opportunities for officers to encounter people who should be off the streets. \u201cWe are eliminating more and more interactions with criminals by not allowing us to enforce the laws that are on the books,\u201d said DeBoard, who was the president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police as the group fought the bill. \u201cA lot of times you stop a vehicle, you have no idea the race, color, creed, religion of the person you're stopping,\u201d DeBoard said. \u201cYou see a violation, you stop the car. And at night, you definitely don\u2019t know who you\u2019re stopping. So it is not about targeting.\u201d Virginia started collecting detailed traffic stop statistics only in June 2020. The early data suggest that the law is having some effect on how the roads are policed. In the first four months after the law was enacted \u2014 March to June \u2014 the number of overall traffic stops rose by 7 percent compared to the previous four months, which experts said isn\u2019t surprising given that warmer weather tends to attract more drivers to the roads. But the number of motorists subjected to searches after having been pulled over \u2014 the category that the reformers care about most \u2014 dropped sharply, according to an NBC News analysis of police data obtained in a public records request. The number of Black drivers who were searched fell by 40 percent, and the number of white drivers dropped by 30 percent, the data show. Black people still accounted for about 30 percent of all traffic stops \u2014 the same percentage as before the law was changed \u2014 even though they are about 20 percent of the population of Virginia. White people, who make up 65 percent of the population, accounted for slightly under 65 percent of the stops before and after the law was changed, the early data show. Da\u2019Quan Marcell Love, the executive director of the Virginia NAACP, said the decline in the number of searches of Black drivers shows that the reforms are broadly working. But he said advocates are waiting to see how the situation plays out in the long term. \u201cWe have to give it time to work,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe are not launching a celebration any time soon.\u201d Officers stop about 20 million drivers a year, according to federal estimates, for reasons from speeding to blowing through reds light to expired tags. The vast majority of the encounters last only a few minutes and result in tickets or warnings, research shows. Police across the country have long been criticized for using minor infractions such as broken taillights as reasons to stop motorists and investigate them for possible crimes. Criminologists and civil rights lawyers have panned the tactic as a fishing expedition rife with racial bias that yields few results. Frank Baumgartner, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed more than 24 million traffic stops across North Carolina from 2002 to 2020. He found that the encounters led to arrests about 2 percent of the time. Searches also rarely occurred, and when they did, weapons were discovered in one-tenth of 1 percent of incidents. Black people were the subjects of nearly half the stops, Baumgartner found, even though they are only 21 percent of the state\u2019s population. \u201cFor every one bad guy they catch, they alienate, like, 18 young Black men,\u201d Baumgartner said. \u201cThat's where we get to the crisis of trust with the police.\u201d That type of traffic stop led to two of the highest-profile police killings in recent years: those of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Both were Black men who were shot and killed by officers after having been pulled over for broken taillights. Officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder of Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked coast-to-coast calls for reform. Faced with overwhelming public pressure, elected officials are increasingly moving forward with measures to strip away police powers regardless of whether law enforcement leaders support them. Last month, the top prosecutor in Ramsey County, Minnesota, where Castile was killed, announced that he would no longer prosecute  most cases that stem from non-public-safety traffic stops, such as expired tags. He cited the disproportionate impact on people of color, especially Black people, among other reasons. \u201cThe outcome of these stops is that it yields very, very little contraband,\u201d said the prosecutor, County Attorney John Choi. \u201cIf I thought that this would lead to more problems from a public safety perspective, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Larger police departments in Choi\u2019s county supported the move, but the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association described it as \u201cinsulting.\u201d More statewide bans may be on the horizon as politicians continue to openly shrug off opposition from police. Inspired by the change in Virginia\u2019s law, Joe Nguyen, a Democratic state senator in Washington, recently introduced legislation that would prohibit police from pulling motorists over for failing to stop, driving without licenses and other violations. \u201cWe passed a few bills last year that didn\u2019t have law enforcement support, so it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of,\u201d Nguyen said. Some police chiefs across the country, in places like Oakland, California; Minneapolis; and Portland, Oregon, have retooled their traffic enforcement policies to avoid unnecessary confrontations with drivers. The Oakland Police Department issued a directive five years ago discouraging officers from pulling people over for low-level offenses like equipment violations and expired registrations. Since the policies were put in place, the percentage of Black drivers who were stopped fell from 62 percent in 2016 to 51 percent in 2019. The police department enlisted Stanford University to examine its data, which showed that under 3 percent of stops in 2013 and 2014 were linked to more serious crimes. Deputy Police Chief Christopher Bolton urged Oakland police brass reluctant to reform to take a hard look at the statistics. \u201cWhy are we continuing to do those stops when the data is showing that not only is it not effective and efficient, but it could very well be damaging public trust and confidence in what our strategies are?\u201d Bolton asked. But in San Francisco, District Attorney Chesa Boudin\u2019s push to end \u201cpretextual\u201d traffic stops has met fierce resistance from the police. During his second month in office, Boudin told staff members to refrain from prosecuting people who were stopped for minor infractions and found to have \u201ccontraband,\u201d including drugs and guns. Union officials slammed Boudin for creating an environment in which criminals feel comfortable to break the law without fear of punishment. \u201cIf they want to continue to handcuff the police in doing their jobs, the unintended consequences are going to be more crime victims,\u201d said Tony Montoya, the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Union officials blame Boudin\u2019s new traffic policy for the release of a man who was accused of fatally shooting two people weeks after he was pulled over and found with an assault-style rifle without a serial number. The district attorney\u2019s office said its decision not to pursue charges against the suspect, Robert Newt, had nothing to do with the circumstances of the stop. The investigators didn\u2019t provide DNA or fingerprints that could tie Newt to the gun, Boudin\u2019s office said. Rachel Marshall, a spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office, said the policy \u201coffers room for exceptions.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office said it has rejected about one to two cases a month because of Boudin\u2019s rules, for a total of 11 this year. \u201cRacial profiling undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and fosters distrust in communities of color \u2014 all of which decreases public safety,\u201d Marshall said. Police chiefs and sheriffs in Virginia say that the state\u2019s ban went too far and that it is putting lives at risk at a time when murders and fatal accidents are already soaring. The original bill, in fact, would have gone even further by blocking police from stopping vehicles with no front lights. The governor\u2019s office cut the measure after Chesterfield County Police Chief Jeffrey Katz blasted it in a viral Facebook post. The new law permits a driver to have one broken headlight. \u201cLawmakers were making decisions based on the loudest voices in the room, but not necessarily the most informed voices in the room,\u201d Katz said in an interview. \u201cAnd all you have to do is look at the crime rate in the last year and a half.\u201d As in many other states, the number of murders in Virginia has risen sharply since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Virginia State Police. Even though officers can still cite people for speeding and erratic driving, rural county sheriffs said the ban creates an atmosphere in which reckless motorists feel safe to break the law, and they warned that traffic deaths will rise. Fatal traffic accidents in the six months after the law was changed hit a 10-year high, according to an NBC News analysis that compared them to the same period going back to 2011. Jessica Cowardin, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said the rise in traffic deaths mirrors national figures, which are also up. Federal officials blame the increase on speeding, drunk drivers and people who don\u2019t wear seat belts \u2014 violations that police in Virginia can still enforce. For some Virginia police chiefs, the concerns go beyond traffic accidents. In Petersburg, about 20 miles south of Richmond, officers confiscated more than 1,000 guns in the three years leading up to the ban, often in vehicle stops, Police Chief Travis Christian said. But his office was unable to provide data backing up the claim. The analysis of arrest data found that weapons were discovered in about 7 percent of traffic stops in Petersburg from 2018 to 2020. As a chief who is Black, Christian said he is \u201ctorn\u201d over the new law. He acknowledged that Black Virginians feel targeted by police when they are behind the wheel, but he said he still wants the ban reversed. \u201cIt has given us the ability to use it as an investigative tool to get to other crimes that have been committed,\u201d Christian said. \u201cThat tool has been eliminated for us.\u201d David Weisburd, a criminology professor and the executive director of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, said he wasn\u2019t aware of any data that support the claim that low-level traffic stops help to reduce crime. \u201cIt is time, in my view, for the police to bring evidence to their arguments,\u201d Weisburd said. \u201cThat evidence could help in deciding what is reasonable or unreasonable or what is good policing from what is awful policing.\u201d The new law hasn\u2019t put an end to controversial stops in Virginia. Five days after the ban went into effect, state troopers pulled over Juanisha Brooks, 35, a Black woman who is a senior video producer for the Defense Department, as she was driving along a highway in Northern Virginia. A trooper ordered her to get out of the vehicle several times, saying he wanted to show her what was wrong with her car. Brooks refused, saying she didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t tell her while she remained in the vehicle. Dashcam video appears to show the trooper dragging Brooks out of the seat and pushing her up against her car. Officers charged her with reckless driving, eluding, obstruction of justice and failing to have her headlights on. Prosecutors dropped the case, noting that the stop was illegal because of the reforms. Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, insisted that the arrest was fair because Brooks refused to comply with the trooper\u2019s commands. State Police conducted an internal investigation; Geller said she couldn\u2019t share whether the trooper was disciplined because of privacy rules. \u201cI was afraid for my life,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be another hashtag.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ems-services-warn-crippling-labor-shortage-undermining-911-system-rcna2677", "title": "EMS services warn of 'crippling labor shortage' undermining 911 system", "subtitle": "\u201cWe\u2019re not bleeding any longer \u2014 we\u2019re hemorrhaging,\u201d one ambulance service operator said of a decadelong worker shortage exacerbated by the pandemic.", "author": "By Phil McCausland", "section": null, "body": "The pandemic-induced shortage of emergency medical technicians and paramedics nationwide is so dire that ambulance service providers warn of sharp cuts to services and longer waits for 911 calls \u2014 even when it\u2019s a matter of life or death. Companies have had to close, consolidate or come up with new strategies to answer calls, said American Ambulance Association President Shawn Baird, who added that there is simply not enough EMS personnel to cover calls in many parts of the country, especially during the pandemic. The loss of staff to pandemic-related burnout and low wages has created a vicious cycle, requiring greater dependence on those workers who have stayed on. The situation has deteriorated to such a degree in recent months that ambulance services and industry leaders are pleading with Congress and state legislatures to help. \"The magnitude has really blown up over the last few months,\" Baird said. \"When you take a system that was already fragile and stretched it, because you didn't have enough people entering the field, then you throw a public health emergency and all of the additional burdens that it put on our workforce as well as the labor shortages across the entire economy, and it really has put us in a crisis mode.\" It's a crisis that has made it difficult to hire and even harder to retain EMTs and paramedics, according to a AAA survey of 258 EMS organizations across the country. In 2020, nearly a third of the workforce left their ambulance company after less than a year, the survey said. Eleven percent left within the first three months. \"It's almost unmanageable,\" said Ken Cummings, who leads Tri-Hospital EMS in Port Huron, Michigan. \"I don't think any EMS provider wants to go out in public and say that your service might be interrupted, but the reality is that because of the extremely low workforce situation right now, we are going to start to see delays. We're already seeing that throughout the country right now.\" Cummings said he currently has 10 openings, about 10 percent of his workforce. He's currently paying double overtime to fill the gap left by those empty positions, but that has increased the average work week of his paramedics by at least eight hours. The amount of money he's paying in overtime is also becoming untenable, and his workers are losing interest in the extra cash. \"We're spending money today that we're hoping we get tomorrow, to be real honest with you,\" he said. \"It's not a long-term solution.\" There are an estimated 1,000 open EMS positions in Michigan alone, Cummings said. The good news for Cummings is that he has a handful of students who will graduate next year from the paramedic program, but the churn is constant. The Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, also agreed to allocate $12.9 million of the state's budget to increase reimbursement rates. But that has not slowed the revolving-door nature of the job. Among full-time EMTs, 47 percent reported in 2020 that the reason for leaving was for a career or occupation change, according to the survey. That number is 45 percent among paramedics. \"In my experience running an EMS service, I've seen more than a few employees get into the industry and leave within six months,\" said Judd Smith, the program director of Texas EMS School in Abilene. \"I'll see people work for three weeks and then move on to the next thing.\" The decline in Texas has been particularly substantial. By mid-August, only 27 percent of licensed EMS professionals had submitted a patient care record, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, meaning that over 70 percent of licensed Texas EMTs did not work on an ambulance in the first eight months of the year. That represents a significant drop from the 43 percent of EMTs who submitted reports in 2020 and the 45 percent who did in 2019. The circumstances have pushed the American Ambulance Association and National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians to send a letter to Congress last week pushing for a hearing to address the shortfall and asking for more funding to increase wages. The letter warned that \"our nation\u2019s EMS system is facing a crippling workforce shortage, a long-term problem that has been building for more than a decade. It threatens to undermine our emergency 9-1-1 infrastructure and deserves urgent attention by the Congress.\" The pandemic has made a bad labor problem worse. The spread of the virus, the frequency of calls, worry of potential infection and the necessary safeguards that emergency personnel must take to protect themselves have created additional stress that has caused many to leave the field, providers said. Their departure has then increased the need for those who remain to work overtime, pushing even more to leave the field. The nationwide health emergency also caused many EMT and paramedic courses to shut down, meaning there is a dearth of students coming into the industry. \"We're not bleeding any longer \u2014 we're hemorrhaging,\" said Gary Wadaga, who operates Bay Ambulance in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Ambulance companies have faced years of workforce challenges that has damaged their ability to respond to calls quickly, but the situation is getting worse. Last year, because an ambulance service closed south of his company's service area, Wadaga had to take on an additional 100 square miles of territory. Now he covers 1,500 square miles and receives about 1,000 calls a year with six paramedic positions. The trouble is, he's been unable to fill two spots and has another two workers on leave, leaving him and one other person to respond to every emergency call that comes in. \"I've not seen it this bad in 41 years, and you can't just set that aside,\" said Wadaga, adding that the increasing demands of the job have caused him great anxiety. \"You want to be there for your community, but the fact that one day we're not going to have enough people absolutely bothers me.\" Ambulance companies once had the luxury of considering applicants, but that appears to be a concept of the past. Now companies are actively recruiting and even going after one another's employees because the pool of eligible workers is so small. \"Overall, it's robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Baird, \"because every community needs these folks.\" Wadaga and other ambulance service operators said the pandemic has increased the viciousness of a labor shortage and put the nation's emergency medical system at risk of a \"death spiral\" that could be difficult to pull out of. The salary requests of a shrinking workforce are getting higher as wages remain stagnant. The 2020 median pay for EMTs and paramedics was $36,650 per year or $17.62 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about a 7.5 percent increase since 2011. Advocates said the wages don't match the requirements of the job anymore. \"When you're an EMS provider putting your life on the line and entering into a closed environments with infectious patients and you can make more money to work in an Amazon warehouse, it becomes really difficult to retain people,\" said Robert Luckritz, who serves as chair of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians' EMS Workforce Committee. But it's not just retail and warehouse work that's calling. Luckritz said that hospitals facing their own nursing and health care worker shortages are at times actively recruiting EMT and paramedics, promising higher wages, better hours and increased benefits. That's an issue Luckritz and his colleagues are attempting to work on, but it's a challenge. They need more money to hire more people, but ambulance company rates are set by insurance providers and the government when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, which both contribute to the vast majority of calls, Luckritz said. \"Unlike much of the other industries across the country ... we're not able to raise our prices \u2014 our prices are set by the government,\" he said. \"So with reimbursement not keeping up with our costs, it makes it very difficult for us to compete for the workforce.\" The fear is that if the country doesn't face these problems now, they will be unfixable down the line. Baird, the AAA president, said that if things spiral too far down, \"we can\u2019t get people to even enter the field because it looks too daunting.\" \"We have to turn this around,\" he said. One silver lining is that online EMS programs, such as Smith's Texas EMS School, are seeing increased interest \u2014 even as nationwide there is a decline in enrollment in traditional programs. The number of applications for their EMT program, which can be completed in 10 to 18 weeks via a mix of online coursework and hands-on clinical and field experience, jumped from 495 applicants in 2019 to 1,469 in 2021. The jobs certainly are there waiting for them at graduation. \"I don't know of any one of our students that doesn't get hired within the first week of getting licensed,\" Smith said. \"We've even had a big number of them get hired before they even received their certification, so they start working as soon as they're done.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-stake-2022-hopes-child-cash-benefits-there-s-just-n1281142", "title": "Democrats stake 2022 hopes on child cash benefits.

But in doing so, they planted an election-year time bomb for their own party, and their only realistic hope of defusing it in time is to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s social spending bill. At the center of the American Rescue Plan is a monthly payment structured as a tax credit for the vast majority of families \u2014 of $300 per child under 6 years old or $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. The benefit has been well received in polls, and studies say it quickly lifted millions of U.S. kids out of poverty. But there\u2019s a catch: It is only authorized for 2021. The payments end in December unless extended. With Republicans opposed, the only realistic vehicle to extend them is Biden\u2019s multitrillion-dollar bill, which Democratic leaders are working feverishly to craft. Allowing the payments to expire would risk erasing the economic gains and leaving struggling parents who have come to rely on it in the lurch. Democratic operatives warn it could turn a significant political asset into a liability just months before an election in which Republicans are historically favored to make gains. \u201cLetting the extremely popular child care tax credit expire would be exactly the type of mistake we can\u2019t afford,\u201d Tyler Law, a Democratic consultant who worked for the party\u2019s House election arm during the 2018 blue wave, said. \u201cDemocrats need to deliver win after win after win to show voters we can govern and deserve to stay in power,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet for success, but there\u2019s certainly a recipe for disaster: failing to pass the Biden agenda.\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the child tax credit has had a major impact in alleviating poverty and held it up as an example that says Democrats, when in charge, can help Americans. \u201cThe idea of letting it expire, I think, would be horrific,\u201d he said. While Democrats battle over what provisions make it into the bill, they appear to agree unanimously that the money for kids should be extended \u2014 from centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., to progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. But the details are unclear. The House version of the bill extends the payments through 2025. That may be adjusted as lawmakers sort out how to cut down the plan's price tag to get the centrists on board. And the income threshold for who is eligible may be adjusted as Manchin has demanded additional means-testing for the various programs in the bill. \u201cThere's some differences of opinion about how to do it, and how long to fund it, etcetera. And it has to fit within the overall top line of the bill,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. \u201cBut every Dem really wants it to happen.\u201d Republicans are adamantly opposed to the program and say it should expire. \u201cThe federal government shouldn't be in the business of just handing out money because you have kids,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said. \u201cThat's ridiculous.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Democrats of \u201ctrying to build a permanent welfare class in the country,\u201d saying the child tax credit includes \u201cdistributing more borrowed money to people who don't have a need for it.\u201d Some Democrats are spoiling for that fight. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the party\u2019s House campaign arm, projected confidence that Democrats will pass the bill, extend the child cash payments and then run on them. \u201cWe're going to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact that the Republicans have opposed it at every step of the way will come back to haunt them. I believe that it's exactly that type of thing that is the anvil on which we will hammer them in 2022.\u201d Sean McElwee, a progressive pollster who has been cited by the White House, said his firm has found that voters who received the child cash payment approve of Biden's job performance by a wide margin of 66 percent to 32 percent, whereas voters who haven't gotten it split evenly with 49 percent approving and disapproving. The firm, Data for Progress, found that those who voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020 and who receive the child tax credit register 79 percent disapproval of Biden, whereas 92 percent of those who do not receive it disapprove of the president. \u201cEnding the child tax credit would risk washing away these key persuasion gains that will be necessary to win in 2022 and 2024,\u201d McElwee said. Overall, the child cash payments are supported by 59 percent of U.S. adults, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. That includes 75 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of Republicans. Some of the states with the highest average per-month cash payments are conservative states. Progressives cite the program as an example of how government can make Americans' lives better. \u201cWe already have powerful data showing us that this tax credit is reducing hunger in America. It's providing school shoes and backpacks for kids to be able to go back to school,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u201cWe need to protect this \u2014 not just because it expires in an election year.

The cast of \u201cSquid Game\u201d features some of South Korea\u2019s biggest stars, including Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist, Seong Gi-hun, a hopelessly indebted father who receives a business card from a stranger offering him a way out. Along with 455 other contestants \u2014 from all walks of life but all deeply in debt too \u2014 he agrees to compete for a cash prize of 45.6 billion won (about $38 million) by playing a series of traditional Korean children\u2019s games, only to discover that elimination from each round means death. \u201cThere\u2019s this dissonance between Korean pride that this Korean show is dominating Netflix all around the world, and the discomfort with what the show appears to expose about Korea,\u201d said CedarBough Saeji, an assistant professor of Korean and East Asian studies at Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea. \u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing.\u201d That South Korea also produced \u201cParasite,\u201d the 2020 Oscar winner for best picture that also focused on themes of inequality, has probably accentuated this discomfort, Saeji said. Still, \u201cSquid Game\u201d is wildly popular in its home country. The show was released on Sept. 17 just before Chuseok, a Korean holiday similar to Thanksgiving when families gather, the perfect time for binge-watching. The surge in network traffic led one internet service provider to sue Netflix to cover its costs. The fervor has also spilled over into real life. A street vendor in Seoul who provided the makers of \u201cSquid Game\u201d with dalgona, a brittle sugar candy at the center of one of the games, told Reuters that he had seen a boom in business. Thousands of curious South Koreans also tried the eight-digit phone number that appears on the business card, which the show\u2019s makers didn\u2019t realize would reach an actual person. The owner of the number, and even people with similar numbers, have been inundated with calls and messages at all hours. On Wednesday, Netflix said it was working with the show\u2019s local production company to address the issue, including editing scenes to remove the number. Park Sae-ha, a senior studying economics at Yonsei University in Seoul, said \u201cSquid Game\u201d was \u201cspell-binding because it was so explicit and blunt.\u201d \u201cAlthough I am young, I could easily relate to the hard reality of a very competitive society,\u201d she said. That intense competitiveness may be one reason South Korea has been so successful, with a period of rapid industrialization starting in the 1960s that turned it into the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. But as in many other countries, a university degree and a white-collar job don\u2019t guarantee the financial security they used to, Saeji said. With an average income of about $42,000 a year, many Koreans now find they have to borrow to keep up. Fueled by low interest rates, household debt in South Korea has grown significantly in recent years, and is now equal to the country\u2019s annual GDP. (In the U.S., by contrast, household debt is about 80 percent of GDP.) People may rack up debt because of credit card spending, unemployment or gambling losses, but a large chunk of it is tied to real estate. Housing prices have been rising fast, especially under President Moon Jae-in, and the average price of an apartment in Seoul is nearing $1 million. Lending curbs and efforts to cool the housing market have done little to rein in household borrowing. In addition to housing, some Koreans, especially young people, borrow money to invest in cryptocurrency. Many Koreans start out by borrowing from legitimate financial institutions like banks, said Koo Se-Woong, a commentator on Korean culture based in Germany. When that avenue is exhausted, they may move on to second-tier lenders that charge higher interest. In the worst-case scenarios, he said, borrowers turn to loan shark operations that can charge triple-digit interest rates, \u201cand then you are pushed into situations from which you really cannot get out.\u201d According to some estimates, there are 400,000 Koreans in debt to loan sharks. \u201cWhen you look at the characters in the show who are participating in this game, they represent that demographic of the Koreans who are in the worst possible situation because of their personal debt,\u201d Koo said. In a recent widely shared Facebook post, Koo said he was shocked when a friend told him he was living paycheck to paycheck, despite having a good job. The friend \u201cdoesn't strike anyone as extravagant,\u201d Koo said, but struggles to afford the trappings of middle-class life: an apartment, a car and occasional travel with his wife and children. \"It's all paid for by loans, I am telling you,\" Koo said his friend told him. \"We just have no money.\" Jung, the security analyst, said the plot of \u201cSquid Game\u201d was easy to accept because \u201cit dealt with such familiar stories of debt-ridden people you come across in real life.\u201d \u201cThe story stems from a deeply rooted perception of how society looks at failure, especially individual financial failure,\u201d he said. Bankruptcy in South Korea is generally seen not as a chance to start over but as a devastating fate. That is underlined in \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Saeji said, when contestants are given the option to leave but choose to keep playing even at the risk of their lives. \u201cIn the regular world it\u2019s not just the death of their body, it\u2019s the death of their pride. It\u2019s the shame of having to be such an unsuccessful person in front of your family,\u201d she said. Viewers in South Korea say the show is all the more disturbing because it injects death and violence into playground games like Red Light, Green Light and tug of war. The show plays on childhood nostalgia \u201cand along with it the innocent times when you had no problems,\u201d said Kim Hern-sik, a pop culture critic in Seoul. \u201cYet the story tells you that escaping from reality is not the answer.\u201d \u201cSquid Game\u201d is \u201cfundamentally a Korean story, featuring games people would remember playing as kids,\u201d Don Kang, vice president of Korean content at Netflix, told NBC News in an email. \u201cSo we knew it would resonate with our members here.\u201d Its popularity in the West came as more of a surprise. But Korean cultural exports have been sweeping Asia for years, and Netflix was already betting on their growing appeal. The company is spending $500 million this year on Korean content, almost as much as it spent in the last five years. Saeji said that after decades of Western cultural influence, the success of \u201cSquid Game\u201d shows that South Korea can make a TV show with a Hollywood feel \u201cand they can do it better.\u201d While \u201cSquid Game\u201d is not the first story about a fight to the death, director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who has a film degree from the University of Southern California, made it influential in his own way, said Oh Dong-jin, a prominent film critic in South Korea. \u201cEvery movie borrows this and that from other movies. What matters, therefore, is how creatively you can borrow from different references,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, even from this standpoint, the traditional children\u2019s games the show uses make 'Squid Game' quite original.\u201d Margie Kim, a housewife in Seoul who is watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d with her family, said that while she enjoyed its intensity and pop-art-influenced visuals, the underlying messages were also important. \u201cI do feel the pain of what our society is going through,\u201d she said. The show deals with so many pressing issues, she said\u2014income inequality, youth unemployment, a rapidly aging society\u2014that it\u2019s something her entire family can relate to and talk about. \u201cSo many middle-class, ordinary people live with so much debt,\u201d she said. \u201cI could totally empathize with people who joined the game.\u201d Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Stella Kim reported from Los Angeles.", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/working-companies-owned-well-heeled-private-equity-firms-can-mean-n1281146", "title": "Working for companies owned by well-heeled private-equity firms can mean lower wages for employees", "subtitle": "Workers at some fast-food chains owned by public firms are getting better wages now. It\u2019s a different story at restaurants owned by private-equity firms.", "author": "By Gretchen Morgenson", "section": null, "body": "Alma Jordan, a certified nursing assistant at the Marcella Center nursing home in Burlington, New Jersey, respected the residents she cared for there over the past 16 years. They were like family, she said, and she believes they\u2019ve appreciated her attentiveness, especially during Covid-19. Not so, the nursing home\u2019s new owner, Jordan said. After Complete Care Management, the largest for-profit nursing home operator in New Jersey, took over the 150-bed Marcella Center in April, it slashed worker benefits, she and other employees as well as a representative from their union told NBC News. Amid the pandemic, Jordan\u2019s paid holidays were reduced, and her monthly health insurance costs more than tripled, she said. The company stopped contributing to the employee pension, replacing it with a 401(k) plan that had no employer match or contribution. Complete Care took away vision insurance and stopped a reimbursement program covering employee education costs, so Jordan, 45, won\u2019t be able to recoup money she spent working toward a degree to become a licensed practical nurse. \u201cI put all my effort into this company, and someone else took over and they don\u2019t want to give us what we deserve,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s business. It\u2019s not about the staff and the residents. It\u2019s only about making profits.\u201d In late September, Jordan quit her position at the facility. The reduced benefits and deteriorating work conditions got to be too much, she said. When Complete Care came in, Jordan and other Marcella workers were operating under a union contract struck with the facility\u2019s previous owner. Complete Care did away with that contract, which also covered four other unionized New Jersey nursing facilities it recently acquired, according to the Service Employees International Union. Complete Care owns 61 facilities in eight states, including Connecticut, Maryland and Wisconsin. It is backed by a private-equity firm called Peace Capital in Lakewood, New Jersey, whose principal owner is Sam Stein. Jordan and her fellow workers are not alone in experiencing reduced circumstances after their company is taken over by a private-equity firm. The new titans of finance, these firms use large pools of debt \u2014 typically raised in what's called the leveraged loan market \u2014 to acquire companies they hope to resell in a few years at a profit. Among companies raising money in this loan market during the past three years, debt levels at private-equity-backed entities were at least 30 percent higher than debt levels at companies not backed by private equity, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. But the heavy debt loads they take on, combined with pressure to flip acquired companies quickly, increases the likelihood that private-equity firms will have to cut costs in the operations that they buy. Often, the first to the chopping block is the company\u2019s workforce. A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research lays this out. Researchers analyzed almost 10,000 debt-fueled buyouts between 1980 and 2013 and found that employment fell by 13 percent when a private-equity firm took over a public company. Employment declined by even more \u2014 16 percent \u2014 when private equity acquired a unit or division of a company. Eileen Appelbaum is an economist and co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, and co-author of \"Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street.\" Her study of private equity has led her to conclude that the industry\u2019s growing clout is not only a concern for workers, but also has the potential to harm the nation\u2019s broader economy. \u201cYou have a lot more ownership of productive resources by investors who don\u2019t know an industry, don\u2019t understand the value of skilled workers and who are just in it to make their profit and get out,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cThat erodes productivity.\u201d Almost 12 million employees, or roughly 7 percent of the U.S. labor force, work for private-equity-backed businesses, according to the American Investment Council, an industry lobbying group. These companies generated about 6.5 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product last year, the group said. The council said private-equity firms create jobs, support businesses and help provide comfortable retirements for pensioners invested in the strategy. A spokeswoman for Complete Care echoed this view. She said the company is committed to the long-term viability of its facilities, adding in a statement: \u201cWe offer a comprehensive health plan and competitive benefits, and our facilities are known as great places to work.\u201d The company is negotiating a new union contract, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, though, care at the Marcella facility is declining, Jordan said, days after she quit. \u201cWe were very short-staffed,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think the residents pick up on that because it takes longer to answer a call.\u201d In a statement, a spokesperson for Complete Care said, \u201cComplete Care at Marcella consistently maintains state mandated ratios. ... We take whatever measures necessary to ensure that we have proper staffing to meet the needs of those in our care, including bringing in agency staff and offering bonuses as needed.\" Private equity is a sophisticated investment strategy that has grown furiously in recent years. At the end of last year, assets under management at the firms worldwide stood at $5 trillion, up from $1.5 trillion over the past decade, according to Preqin, a financial data provider. The number of funds devoted to these activities has more than doubled during that period, and last year, private-equity firms paid some $600 billion to acquire companies, up from $250 billion 10 years earlier. Private-equity firms began their climb to power in the 1980s; then they were known as leveraged buyout shops, because of the debt they use. The $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988 by private-equity giant Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts brought such deals to center stage. In recent years, as prevailing interest rates collapsed, private-equity operations have been able to take on greater amounts of low-cost debt to make their acquisitions. Through Sept. 27, for example, $472 billion of leveraged loans were issued, up from $237 billion issued during the same period in 2019, according to LCD of S&P Global. Outside investors, such as public pension funds and endowments, pour money into these takeover deals in the hopes of generating high returns. But recently, as the stock market has roared, outsize returns in private equity have all but vanished, academic studies show, and they are now in line with overall market performance. Nevertheless, more companies are owned by private-equity firms now than trade on the nation\u2019s stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, private-equity firms\u2019 rising dominance has generated immense wealth for their executives. The value of Sam Stein's holdings in Complete Care could not be determined and the company declined to provide it, but it is almost certainly dwarfed by those of Stephen Schwarzman, head of Blackstone Group. A close adviser to Donald Trump during his presidency, Schwarzman is worth $35 billion, according to Forbes magazine, up from $15 billion in 2020. Private equity also benefited from recent government interventions related to the Covid pandemic, documents show. At least $5 billion in federal bailout money went to companies backed by large and well-capitalized private-equity firms, according to a recent report from Americans for Financial Reform. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board launched an unprecedented $750 billion program to prop up the corporate bond market, where many of these firms raise money for their buyouts. Among the bonds purchased by the Fed, documents show, were those issued by Blackstone and another private-equity giant, Apollo Global Management, founded by Leon Black. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently testified that the agency would increase its scrutiny on fee disclosures and conflicts of interest among private funds, to ensure their practices don't put investors in these strategies at a disadvantage. And Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a late September memo outlining the agency's priorities that \"the growing role of private equity\" invites an examination of how these firms' business models \"may facilitate unfair methods of competition and consumer protection violations.\" Finally, the Democrats\u2019 proposed tax increase on capital gains may crimp private-equity executives\u2019 earnings. A key reason many of these executives have been able to amass such fortunes is that so much of their earnings are taxed as capital gains with a top rate of 20 percent, not at the higher 37 percent rate that can apply to income. This is a benefit they've tapped for decades, often allowing them to pay a lower tax rate on earnings than a secretary or a teacher might. One of the nation\u2019s biggest private-equity employers is Roark Capital of Atlanta. It owns Inspire Brands \u2014 parent company to an array of fast-food chains that includes Arby\u2019s, Dunkin\u2019, Baskin-Robbins and Sonic \u2014 and other brands such as Cinnabon and Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee. NBC News estimates that more than 700,000 people work at Inspire Brands, many at independently owned franchise stores. Roark is named for the libertarian protagonist in \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d by Ayn Rand, whose life \u201cexemplified the qualities of independence and integrity,\u201d the company\u2019s website said. One of libertarianism's basic tenets is limited government, but three dozen companies owned by Roark obtained $183 million in federal assistance under the CARES Act, according to the Americans for Financial Reform report. Asked whether this acceptance of government funding ran counter to a limited government stance, Roark declined to comment through a spokeswoman. Zella Roberts, a recent graduate of Warren Wilson College near Asheville, North Carolina, worked as a carhop at a Sonic Drive-In earlier this year to help pay tuition. Her all-in pay plummeted during the pandemic, Roberts told NBC News, because customers\u2019 cash usage fell and Sonic did not allow tips on credit cards. Roberts said she and some colleagues sent an email to Roark Capital \"explaining the conditions that Sonic workers experience. The big ask was to put pressure on Sonic corporate to make these changes.\" She said she never heard back about that or other messages sent to Neal Aronson, managing partner and founder of Roark Capital. Aronson is the controlling owner of Roark, regulatory filings show, which has $18.6 billion in assets under management. Through a spokeswoman, Aronson declined to comment. In January, after Roberts had collected 7,800 signatures on a petition asking Roark to change its policy, the company allowed tips on credit card orders placed through its app. An improvement, Roberts acknowledged, but such orders are a small percentage of those made via credit cards, she pointed out. The Inspire Brands spokesman said barring tips on credit cards \u201cis a technology limitation that we inherited when we purchased the brand\u201d in 2018. \u201cWe are now working on implementing the credit card tipping capability,\u201d he said. Inspire Brands has also worked to battle the Raise the Wage Act, which has been introduced in Congress every year since 2017 and would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour among workers like Roberts. In March, Inspire sent a memo to franchise owners highlighting its lobbying success in opposing the change. Describing its efforts, Inspire said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you\u2019re on the menu, and you can guarantee your opponents are eating!\u201d Chris Fuller, a spokesman for Inspire Brands, said the company fought the national minimum wage legislation because \u201cwe don\u2019t support a one-size-fits-all approach to the minimum wage. We believe in letting the local markets dictate.\u201d He added: \u201cMore than 90 percent of our team members at corporate-owned restaurants are above the state or local minimum wage.\u201d Some Inspire Brands workers have taken matters into their own hands. This summer, Matthew Honeycutt, 18, was working at an Arby\u2019s in Charlotte, North Carolina, making $9.50 an hour as a shift manager. He supports an 8-month-old son. On July 20, he and a group of workers walked off the job seeking a pay raise, forcing managers to close the Arby\u2019s store two hours early, Honeycutt said. That got management\u2019s attention, he said. \u201cThe strike was on a Tuesday, and it was about Thursday when he started getting the raises out,\u201d Honeycutt said of his boss, who gave him a 50-cents-an-hour raise. \"Every kind of worker you can think of is working so hard, but they're not getting paid what they\u2019re worth.\" Honeycutt\u2019s boss did not respond to a voicemail message seeking comment. In mid-September, Honeycutt quit his job at Arby's for a higher-paying position elsewhere. While Inspire Brands fights against a higher minimum wage, some other restaurant companies owned by publicly traded companies are taking a different approach. They say increasing worker pay is good for business. In February, Robert Verostek, the chief financial officer of restaurant chain Denny\u2019s, told investors that paying a higher wage to its workers in California had resulted in \u201cnot just positive sales, but positive guest traffic.\u201d And in May, McDonald's began increasing pay by 10 percent for almost 37,000 workers in company-owned stores. Shift managers like Honeycutt, who earned $10 at Arby\u2019s, are earning between $15 and $20 an hour depending on the location, McDonald\u2019s said. Sean Dunlop, an equity analyst at Morningstar Research, said Inspire Brands is a well-managed company. But increasing pay and benefits among workers is an industry trend it won't be able to resist. \"As you\u2019re thinking about bigger chains, not only are they making a broader push to a $15 average wage at restaurants, you\u2019ve also seen them offer tuition assistance, paid time off, retention bonuses and referral bonuses as they\u2019ve been trying to attract workers,\" Dunlop said. \"Inspire Brands, if they want to compete, are going to be forced to raise wages. They're going to have to, whether they want to or not.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/silicon-valley-area-food-banks-strain-under-growing-logistical-needs-n1281047", "title": "Silicon Valley area food banks strain under growing logistical needs of poverty", "subtitle": "\u201cInfrastructure requirements have sorely taxed the charitable food system at a time when demand is still extraordinarily high,\u201d one expert said.", "author": "By Cyrus Farivar", "section": null, "body": "RICHMOND, Calif. \u2014 On a recent unseasonably warm October day, dozens of Californians gathered at a food distribution site on a vast, unshaded blacktop space behind an elementary school. In one hour, 193 people waited patiently to fill their carts and shopping bags with produce like bell peppers, apples, onions and squash from the side of a massive truck. \u201cThat\u2019s a record for this year,\u201d said Matthew Durkin, 30, the mobile distribution supervisor, while nodding at the clients and noting that he usually sees only about 160 people. \u201cIt means there\u2019s an increased need.\u201d Durkin, of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, says that while demand for free food has slowed slightly from the start of the pandemic, people are still hungry. \u201cWe have seen another jump in numbers within the last few months. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, adding that many clients have told them how much they fear returning to work. \"They are concerned about Covid-19 surges, as so many of us are, and some of them may need to stay available for unexpected changes in child care and school due to Covid exposures or cases.\u201d More than 18 months into the pandemic, San Francisco Bay Area nonprofit organizations, from food banks to shelters for domestic violence victims, say that they are seeing more demand for their services than they ever saw before the pandemic. Even now, there are still two members of the California National Guard working at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties\u2019 central warehouse in Fairfield. As the pandemic drags on, these support facilities are also struggling with supply chain problems to meet the seemingly endless demand. It presents even more challenges as supplies and workers grow more scarce. Joel Sjostrom, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, has watched the food bank\u2019s demand grow to 300,000 people at the height of the pandemic from 178,000 before the pandemic began. He is now still trying to find support for 240,000 clients each month. Almost immediately after the March 2020 shelter-in-place order was instituted, he said, his organization lost 35 percent of its volunteer workforce because it depends so heavily on older volunteers who were scared to work before they were vaccinated. He had to call in members of the California National Guard, two of which remain. \u201cTo meet those volume increases, we have had to step up facilities and transportation,\u201d Sjostrom added. \u201cI had heard of the National Guard being helpful to others in Southern California.\u201d At one point, there were as many as 25 soldiers working to help this one bank. In California, the National Guard, as of Thursday, still had 140 soldiers deployed to food banks across 16 counties, down from a high of 767 in April 2020, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan M. Shiroma, a California National Guard spokesperson. But the National Guard is gradually trying to cut those numbers back and deploy these workers to other missions. In addition to help from the National Guard, Sjostrom has hired more full-time staff. But even now, even with 16 drivers, he still would like four more \u201cClass A\u201d drivers who can operate big rig trucks. In order to stay competitive with other outfits that employ drivers, he said he has had to raise his rates from $28 per hour to $30 per hour. \u201cIt\u2019s truly market pressure,\u201d Sjostrom said. \u201cAmazon has ads out, as does Hello Fresh, and driver demand is everywhere.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/traffic-stops-are-flashpoint-policing-america-reformers-are-winning-big-n1280594", "title": "Police face a 'crisis of trust' with Black motorists.

Police chiefs aren't happy.", "author": "By Simone Weichselbaum, Emily R. Siegel and Andrew Blankstein", "section": null, "body": "In the months after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, public defenders in Virginia saw an opportunity to overhaul policing in the state. Among their key priorities to address racial disparities: a ban on traffic stops for such infractions as broken taillights, tinted windows and the aroma of marijuana. What happened next stunned police officials across Virginia. In just three months, the ban the public defenders pitched to Democratic legislators sailed to the governor\u2019s desk and was signed into law. With Covid-19 shutting down the state Capitol and forcing the legislative sessions to take place via Zoom, the law enforcement officials who objected to the bill had failed to galvanize the opposition. In March, Virginia became the first state to prohibit the kind of low-level traffic stops that disproportionately affect people of color and are often used as pretexts to search for drugs and weapons. An NBC News analysis of the early data shows that the measure is having an impact on the percentage of Black motorists searched by police during traffic stops. \u201cAs public defenders, we aren\u2019t exactly used to winning, let alone winning big,\u201d said Brad Haywood, the chief public defender for Arlington County and executive director of Justice Forward, a criminal justice reform organization made up of public defenders across the state. \u201cThis will dramatically reduce race-based policing and impact so many lives.\u201d Long a cornerstone of American law enforcement, the traffic stop has emerged as a flashpoint in the debate over police reform. Over the last 20 months, district attorneys in California and Minnesota have ordered prosecutors to drop cases in which officers found guns or drugs during traffic stops for minor infractions. Other states, including Washington and Massachusetts, are considering restrictions similar to Virginia\u2019s. Proponents describe the measures as a long overdue step in banishing a tactic that targets mainly Black drivers and fails to improve public safety. But many law enforcement officials argue that they\u2019re being stripped of a crucial tool that they say helps to reduce vehicle deaths and remove criminals, guns and drugs from the streets, although the police chiefs and sheriffs interviewed for this article struggled to provide data backing up their case. Maggie DeBoard, the chief of the Herndon Police Department in Virginia, said stripping police of the ability to make certain traffic stops will make the roads more susceptible to traffic accidents and create fewer opportunities for officers to encounter people who should be off the streets. \u201cWe are eliminating more and more interactions with criminals by not allowing us to enforce the laws that are on the books,\u201d said DeBoard, who was the president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police as the group fought the bill. \u201cA lot of times you stop a vehicle, you have no idea the race, color, creed, religion of the person you're stopping,\u201d DeBoard said. \u201cYou see a violation, you stop the car. And at night, you definitely don\u2019t know who you\u2019re stopping. So it is not about targeting.\u201d Virginia started collecting detailed traffic stop statistics only in June 2020. The early data suggest that the law is having some effect on how the roads are policed. In the first four months after the law was enacted \u2014 March to June \u2014 the number of overall traffic stops rose by 7 percent compared to the previous four months, which experts said isn\u2019t surprising given that warmer weather tends to attract more drivers to the roads. But the number of motorists subjected to searches after having been pulled over \u2014 the category that the reformers care about most \u2014 dropped sharply, according to an NBC News analysis of police data obtained in a public records request. The number of Black drivers who were searched fell by 40 percent, and the number of white drivers dropped by 30 percent, the data show. Black people still accounted for about 30 percent of all traffic stops \u2014 the same percentage as before the law was changed \u2014 even though they are about 20 percent of the population of Virginia. White people, who make up 65 percent of the population, accounted for slightly under 65 percent of the stops before and after the law was changed, the early data show. Da\u2019Quan Marcell Love, the executive director of the Virginia NAACP, said the decline in the number of searches of Black drivers shows that the reforms are broadly working. But he said advocates are waiting to see how the situation plays out in the long term. \u201cWe have to give it time to work,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe are not launching a celebration any time soon.\u201d Officers stop about 20 million drivers a year, according to federal estimates, for reasons from speeding to blowing through reds light to expired tags. The vast majority of the encounters last only a few minutes and result in tickets or warnings, research shows. Police across the country have long been criticized for using minor infractions such as broken taillights as reasons to stop motorists and investigate them for possible crimes. Criminologists and civil rights lawyers have panned the tactic as a fishing expedition rife with racial bias that yields few results. Frank Baumgartner, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed more than 24 million traffic stops across North Carolina from 2002 to 2020. He found that the encounters led to arrests about 2 percent of the time. Searches also rarely occurred, and when they did, weapons were discovered in one-tenth of 1 percent of incidents. Black people were the subjects of nearly half the stops, Baumgartner found, even though they are only 21 percent of the state\u2019s population. \u201cFor every one bad guy they catch, they alienate, like, 18 young Black men,\u201d Baumgartner said. \u201cThat's where we get to the crisis of trust with the police.\u201d That type of traffic stop led to two of the highest-profile police killings in recent years: those of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Both were Black men who were shot and killed by officers after having been pulled over for broken taillights. Officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder of Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked coast-to-coast calls for reform. Faced with overwhelming public pressure, elected officials are increasingly moving forward with measures to strip away police powers regardless of whether law enforcement leaders support them. Last month, the top prosecutor in Ramsey County, Minnesota, where Castile was killed, announced that he would no longer prosecute  most cases that stem from non-public-safety traffic stops, such as expired tags. He cited the disproportionate impact on people of color, especially Black people, among other reasons. \u201cThe outcome of these stops is that it yields very, very little contraband,\u201d said the prosecutor, County Attorney John Choi. \u201cIf I thought that this would lead to more problems from a public safety perspective, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Larger police departments in Choi\u2019s county supported the move, but the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association described it as \u201cinsulting.\u201d More statewide bans may be on the horizon as politicians continue to openly shrug off opposition from police. Inspired by the change in Virginia\u2019s law, Joe Nguyen, a Democratic state senator in Washington, recently introduced legislation that would prohibit police from pulling motorists over for failing to stop, driving without licenses and other violations. \u201cWe passed a few bills last year that didn\u2019t have law enforcement support, so it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of,\u201d Nguyen said. Some police chiefs across the country, in places like Oakland, California; Minneapolis; and Portland, Oregon, have retooled their traffic enforcement policies to avoid unnecessary confrontations with drivers. The Oakland Police Department issued a directive five years ago discouraging officers from pulling people over for low-level offenses like equipment violations and expired registrations. Since the policies were put in place, the percentage of Black drivers who were stopped fell from 62 percent in 2016 to 51 percent in 2019. The police department enlisted Stanford University to examine its data, which showed that under 3 percent of stops in 2013 and 2014 were linked to more serious crimes. Deputy Police Chief Christopher Bolton urged Oakland police brass reluctant to reform to take a hard look at the statistics. \u201cWhy are we continuing to do those stops when the data is showing that not only is it not effective and efficient, but it could very well be damaging public trust and confidence in what our strategies are?\u201d Bolton asked. But in San Francisco, District Attorney Chesa Boudin\u2019s push to end \u201cpretextual\u201d traffic stops has met fierce resistance from the police. During his second month in office, Boudin told staff members to refrain from prosecuting people who were stopped for minor infractions and found to have \u201ccontraband,\u201d including drugs and guns. Union officials slammed Boudin for creating an environment in which criminals feel comfortable to break the law without fear of punishment. \u201cIf they want to continue to handcuff the police in doing their jobs, the unintended consequences are going to be more crime victims,\u201d said Tony Montoya, the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Union officials blame Boudin\u2019s new traffic policy for the release of a man who was accused of fatally shooting two people weeks after he was pulled over and found with an assault-style rifle without a serial number. The district attorney\u2019s office said its decision not to pursue charges against the suspect, Robert Newt, had nothing to do with the circumstances of the stop. The investigators didn\u2019t provide DNA or fingerprints that could tie Newt to the gun, Boudin\u2019s office said. Rachel Marshall, a spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office, said the policy \u201coffers room for exceptions.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office said it has rejected about one to two cases a month because of Boudin\u2019s rules, for a total of 11 this year. \u201cRacial profiling undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and fosters distrust in communities of color \u2014 all of which decreases public safety,\u201d Marshall said. Police chiefs and sheriffs in Virginia say that the state\u2019s ban went too far and that it is putting lives at risk at a time when murders and fatal accidents are already soaring. The original bill, in fact, would have gone even further by blocking police from stopping vehicles with no front lights. The governor\u2019s office cut the measure after Chesterfield County Police Chief Jeffrey Katz blasted it in a viral Facebook post. The new law permits a driver to have one broken headlight. \u201cLawmakers were making decisions based on the loudest voices in the room, but not necessarily the most informed voices in the room,\u201d Katz said in an interview. \u201cAnd all you have to do is look at the crime rate in the last year and a half.\u201d As in many other states, the number of murders in Virginia has risen sharply since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Virginia State Police. Even though officers can still cite people for speeding and erratic driving, rural county sheriffs said the ban creates an atmosphere in which reckless motorists feel safe to break the law, and they warned that traffic deaths will rise. Fatal traffic accidents in the six months after the law was changed hit a 10-year high, according to an NBC News analysis that compared them to the same period going back to 2011. Jessica Cowardin, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said the rise in traffic deaths mirrors national figures, which are also up. Federal officials blame the increase on speeding, drunk drivers and people who don\u2019t wear seat belts \u2014 violations that police in Virginia can still enforce. For some Virginia police chiefs, the concerns go beyond traffic accidents. In Petersburg, about 20 miles south of Richmond, officers confiscated more than 1,000 guns in the three years leading up to the ban, often in vehicle stops, Police Chief Travis Christian said. But his office was unable to provide data backing up the claim. The analysis of arrest data found that weapons were discovered in about 7 percent of traffic stops in Petersburg from 2018 to 2020. As a chief who is Black, Christian said he is \u201ctorn\u201d over the new law. He acknowledged that Black Virginians feel targeted by police when they are behind the wheel, but he said he still wants the ban reversed. \u201cIt has given us the ability to use it as an investigative tool to get to other crimes that have been committed,\u201d Christian said. \u201cThat tool has been eliminated for us.\u201d David Weisburd, a criminology professor and the executive director of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, said he wasn\u2019t aware of any data that support the claim that low-level traffic stops help to reduce crime. \u201cIt is time, in my view, for the police to bring evidence to their arguments,\u201d Weisburd said. \u201cThat evidence could help in deciding what is reasonable or unreasonable or what is good policing from what is awful policing.\u201d The new law hasn\u2019t put an end to controversial stops in Virginia. Five days after the ban went into effect, state troopers pulled over Juanisha Brooks, 35, a Black woman who is a senior video producer for the Defense Department, as she was driving along a highway in Northern Virginia. A trooper ordered her to get out of the vehicle several times, saying he wanted to show her what was wrong with her car. Brooks refused, saying she didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t tell her while she remained in the vehicle. Dashcam video appears to show the trooper dragging Brooks out of the seat and pushing her up against her car. Officers charged her with reckless driving, eluding, obstruction of justice and failing to have her headlights on. Prosecutors dropped the case, noting that the stop was illegal because of the reforms. Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, insisted that the arrest was fair because Brooks refused to comply with the trooper\u2019s commands. State Police conducted an internal investigation; Geller said she couldn\u2019t share whether the trooper was disciplined because of privacy rules. \u201cI was afraid for my life,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be another hashtag.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ems-services-warn-crippling-labor-shortage-undermining-911-system-rcna2677", "title": "EMS services warn of 'crippling labor shortage' undermining 911 system", "subtitle": "\u201cWe\u2019re not bleeding any longer \u2014 we\u2019re hemorrhaging,\u201d one ambulance service operator said of a decadelong worker shortage exacerbated by the pandemic.", "author": "By Phil McCausland", "section": null, "body": "The pandemic-induced shortage of emergency medical technicians and paramedics nationwide is so dire that ambulance service providers warn of sharp cuts to services and longer waits for 911 calls \u2014 even when it\u2019s a matter of life or death. Companies have had to close, consolidate or come up with new strategies to answer calls, said American Ambulance Association President Shawn Baird, who added that there is simply not enough EMS personnel to cover calls in many parts of the country, especially during the pandemic. The loss of staff to pandemic-related burnout and low wages has created a vicious cycle, requiring greater dependence on those workers who have stayed on. The situation has deteriorated to such a degree in recent months that ambulance services and industry leaders are pleading with Congress and state legislatures to help. \"The magnitude has really blown up over the last few months,\" Baird said. \"When you take a system that was already fragile and stretched it, because you didn't have enough people entering the field, then you throw a public health emergency and all of the additional burdens that it put on our workforce as well as the labor shortages across the entire economy, and it really has put us in a crisis mode.\" It's a crisis that has made it difficult to hire and even harder to retain EMTs and paramedics, according to a AAA survey of 258 EMS organizations across the country. In 2020, nearly a third of the workforce left their ambulance company after less than a year, the survey said. Eleven percent left within the first three months. \"It's almost unmanageable,\" said Ken Cummings, who leads Tri-Hospital EMS in Port Huron, Michigan. \"I don't think any EMS provider wants to go out in public and say that your service might be interrupted, but the reality is that because of the extremely low workforce situation right now, we are going to start to see delays. We're already seeing that throughout the country right now.\" Cummings said he currently has 10 openings, about 10 percent of his workforce. He's currently paying double overtime to fill the gap left by those empty positions, but that has increased the average work week of his paramedics by at least eight hours. The amount of money he's paying in overtime is also becoming untenable, and his workers are losing interest in the extra cash. \"We're spending money today that we're hoping we get tomorrow, to be real honest with you,\" he said. \"It's not a long-term solution.\" There are an estimated 1,000 open EMS positions in Michigan alone, Cummings said. The good news for Cummings is that he has a handful of students who will graduate next year from the paramedic program, but the churn is constant. The Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, also agreed to allocate $12.9 million of the state's budget to increase reimbursement rates. But that has not slowed the revolving-door nature of the job. Among full-time EMTs, 47 percent reported in 2020 that the reason for leaving was for a career or occupation change, according to the survey. That number is 45 percent among paramedics. \"In my experience running an EMS service, I've seen more than a few employees get into the industry and leave within six months,\" said Judd Smith, the program director of Texas EMS School in Abilene. \"I'll see people work for three weeks and then move on to the next thing.\" The decline in Texas has been particularly substantial. By mid-August, only 27 percent of licensed EMS professionals had submitted a patient care record, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, meaning that over 70 percent of licensed Texas EMTs did not work on an ambulance in the first eight months of the year. That represents a significant drop from the 43 percent of EMTs who submitted reports in 2020 and the 45 percent who did in 2019. The circumstances have pushed the American Ambulance Association and National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians to send a letter to Congress last week pushing for a hearing to address the shortfall and asking for more funding to increase wages. The letter warned that \"our nation\u2019s EMS system is facing a crippling workforce shortage, a long-term problem that has been building for more than a decade. It threatens to undermine our emergency 9-1-1 infrastructure and deserves urgent attention by the Congress.\" The pandemic has made a bad labor problem worse. The spread of the virus, the frequency of calls, worry of potential infection and the necessary safeguards that emergency personnel must take to protect themselves have created additional stress that has caused many to leave the field, providers said. Their departure has then increased the need for those who remain to work overtime, pushing even more to leave the field. The nationwide health emergency also caused many EMT and paramedic courses to shut down, meaning there is a dearth of students coming into the industry. \"We're not bleeding any longer \u2014 we're hemorrhaging,\" said Gary Wadaga, who operates Bay Ambulance in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Ambulance companies have faced years of workforce challenges that has damaged their ability to respond to calls quickly, but the situation is getting worse. Last year, because an ambulance service closed south of his company's service area, Wadaga had to take on an additional 100 square miles of territory. Now he covers 1,500 square miles and receives about 1,000 calls a year with six paramedic positions. The trouble is, he's been unable to fill two spots and has another two workers on leave, leaving him and one other person to respond to every emergency call that comes in. \"I've not seen it this bad in 41 years, and you can't just set that aside,\" said Wadaga, adding that the increasing demands of the job have caused him great anxiety. \"You want to be there for your community, but the fact that one day we're not going to have enough people absolutely bothers me.\" Ambulance companies once had the luxury of considering applicants, but that appears to be a concept of the past. Now companies are actively recruiting and even going after one another's employees because the pool of eligible workers is so small. \"Overall, it's robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Baird, \"because every community needs these folks.\" Wadaga and other ambulance service operators said the pandemic has increased the viciousness of a labor shortage and put the nation's emergency medical system at risk of a \"death spiral\" that could be difficult to pull out of. The salary requests of a shrinking workforce are getting higher as wages remain stagnant. The 2020 median pay for EMTs and paramedics was $36,650 per year or $17.62 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about a 7.5 percent increase since 2011. Advocates said the wages don't match the requirements of the job anymore. \"When you're an EMS provider putting your life on the line and entering into a closed environments with infectious patients and you can make more money to work in an Amazon warehouse, it becomes really difficult to retain people,\" said Robert Luckritz, who serves as chair of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians' EMS Workforce Committee. But it's not just retail and warehouse work that's calling. Luckritz said that hospitals facing their own nursing and health care worker shortages are at times actively recruiting EMT and paramedics, promising higher wages, better hours and increased benefits. That's an issue Luckritz and his colleagues are attempting to work on, but it's a challenge. They need more money to hire more people, but ambulance company rates are set by insurance providers and the government when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, which both contribute to the vast majority of calls, Luckritz said. \"Unlike much of the other industries across the country ... we're not able to raise our prices \u2014 our prices are set by the government,\" he said. \"So with reimbursement not keeping up with our costs, it makes it very difficult for us to compete for the workforce.\" The fear is that if the country doesn't face these problems now, they will be unfixable down the line. Baird, the AAA president, said that if things spiral too far down, \"we can\u2019t get people to even enter the field because it looks too daunting.\" \"We have to turn this around,\" he said. One silver lining is that online EMS programs, such as Smith's Texas EMS School, are seeing increased interest \u2014 even as nationwide there is a decline in enrollment in traditional programs. The number of applications for their EMT program, which can be completed in 10 to 18 weeks via a mix of online coursework and hands-on clinical and field experience, jumped from 495 applicants in 2019 to 1,469 in 2021. The jobs certainly are there waiting for them at graduation. \"I don't know of any one of our students that doesn't get hired within the first week of getting licensed,\" Smith said. \"We've even had a big number of them get hired before they even received their certification, so they start working as soon as they're done.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-stake-2022-hopes-child-cash-benefits-there-s-just-n1281142", "title": "Democrats stake 2022 hopes on child cash benefits.

But in doing so, they planted an election-year time bomb for their own party, and their only realistic hope of defusing it in time is to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s social spending bill. At the center of the American Rescue Plan is a monthly payment structured as a tax credit for the vast majority of families \u2014 of $300 per child under 6 years old or $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. The benefit has been well received in polls, and studies say it quickly lifted millions of U.S. kids out of poverty. But there\u2019s a catch: It is only authorized for 2021. The payments end in December unless extended. With Republicans opposed, the only realistic vehicle to extend them is Biden\u2019s multitrillion-dollar bill, which Democratic leaders are working feverishly to craft. Allowing the payments to expire would risk erasing the economic gains and leaving struggling parents who have come to rely on it in the lurch. Democratic operatives warn it could turn a significant political asset into a liability just months before an election in which Republicans are historically favored to make gains. \u201cLetting the extremely popular child care tax credit expire would be exactly the type of mistake we can\u2019t afford,\u201d Tyler Law, a Democratic consultant who worked for the party\u2019s House election arm during the 2018 blue wave, said. \u201cDemocrats need to deliver win after win after win to show voters we can govern and deserve to stay in power,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet for success, but there\u2019s certainly a recipe for disaster: failing to pass the Biden agenda.\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the child tax credit has had a major impact in alleviating poverty and held it up as an example that says Democrats, when in charge, can help Americans. \u201cThe idea of letting it expire, I think, would be horrific,\u201d he said. While Democrats battle over what provisions make it into the bill, they appear to agree unanimously that the money for kids should be extended \u2014 from centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., to progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. But the details are unclear. The House version of the bill extends the payments through 2025. That may be adjusted as lawmakers sort out how to cut down the plan's price tag to get the centrists on board. And the income threshold for who is eligible may be adjusted as Manchin has demanded additional means-testing for the various programs in the bill. \u201cThere's some differences of opinion about how to do it, and how long to fund it, etcetera. And it has to fit within the overall top line of the bill,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. \u201cBut every Dem really wants it to happen.\u201d Republicans are adamantly opposed to the program and say it should expire. \u201cThe federal government shouldn't be in the business of just handing out money because you have kids,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said. \u201cThat's ridiculous.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Democrats of \u201ctrying to build a permanent welfare class in the country,\u201d saying the child tax credit includes \u201cdistributing more borrowed money to people who don't have a need for it.\u201d Some Democrats are spoiling for that fight. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the party\u2019s House campaign arm, projected confidence that Democrats will pass the bill, extend the child cash payments and then run on them. \u201cWe're going to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact that the Republicans have opposed it at every step of the way will come back to haunt them. I believe that it's exactly that type of thing that is the anvil on which we will hammer them in 2022.\u201d Sean McElwee, a progressive pollster who has been cited by the White House, said his firm has found that voters who received the child cash payment approve of Biden's job performance by a wide margin of 66 percent to 32 percent, whereas voters who haven't gotten it split evenly with 49 percent approving and disapproving. The firm, Data for Progress, found that those who voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020 and who receive the child tax credit register 79 percent disapproval of Biden, whereas 92 percent of those who do not receive it disapprove of the president. \u201cEnding the child tax credit would risk washing away these key persuasion gains that will be necessary to win in 2022 and 2024,\u201d McElwee said. Overall, the child cash payments are supported by 59 percent of U.S. adults, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. That includes 75 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of Republicans. Some of the states with the highest average per-month cash payments are conservative states. Progressives cite the program as an example of how government can make Americans' lives better. \u201cWe already have powerful data showing us that this tax credit is reducing hunger in America. It's providing school shoes and backpacks for kids to be able to go back to school,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u201cWe need to protect this \u2014 not just because it expires in an election year. We need to protect it because this helps American families.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/squid-game-entertaining-world-there-s-different-feeling-south-korea-n1281119", "title": "'Squid Game' is entertaining the world.

Because everyone else is. The nine-episode horror series on Netflix has hit No. 1 in 90 of the streaming service\u2019s markets around the world, including South Korea, where it was made. \u201cI got to the point where I could not hold a conversation without watching the show,\u201d said Jung Dunn, a security analyst in Seoul, the South Korean capital. But the show also strikes a nerve because it unflinchingly addresses a problem that is particularly entrenched in South Korea: debt and the never-ending struggle to pay it off. The cast of \u201cSquid Game\u201d features some of South Korea\u2019s biggest stars, including Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist, Seong Gi-hun, a hopelessly indebted father who receives a business card from a stranger offering him a way out. Along with 455 other contestants \u2014 from all walks of life but all deeply in debt too \u2014 he agrees to compete for a cash prize of 45.6 billion won (about $38 million) by playing a series of traditional Korean children\u2019s games, only to discover that elimination from each round means death. \u201cThere\u2019s this dissonance between Korean pride that this Korean show is dominating Netflix all around the world, and the discomfort with what the show appears to expose about Korea,\u201d said CedarBough Saeji, an assistant professor of Korean and East Asian studies at Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea. \u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing.\u201d That South Korea also produced \u201cParasite,\u201d the 2020 Oscar winner for best picture that also focused on themes of inequality, has probably accentuated this discomfort, Saeji said. Still, \u201cSquid Game\u201d is wildly popular in its home country. The show was released on Sept. 17 just before Chuseok, a Korean holiday similar to Thanksgiving when families gather, the perfect time for binge-watching. The surge in network traffic led one internet service provider to sue Netflix to cover its costs. The fervor has also spilled over into real life. A street vendor in Seoul who provided the makers of \u201cSquid Game\u201d with dalgona, a brittle sugar candy at the center of one of the games, told Reuters that he had seen a boom in business. Thousands of curious South Koreans also tried the eight-digit phone number that appears on the business card, which the show\u2019s makers didn\u2019t realize would reach an actual person. The owner of the number, and even people with similar numbers, have been inundated with calls and messages at all hours. On Wednesday, Netflix said it was working with the show\u2019s local production company to address the issue, including editing scenes to remove the number. Park Sae-ha, a senior studying economics at Yonsei University in Seoul, said \u201cSquid Game\u201d was \u201cspell-binding because it was so explicit and blunt.\u201d \u201cAlthough I am young, I could easily relate to the hard reality of a very competitive society,\u201d she said. That intense competitiveness may be one reason South Korea has been so successful, with a period of rapid industrialization starting in the 1960s that turned it into the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. But as in many other countries, a university degree and a white-collar job don\u2019t guarantee the financial security they used to, Saeji said. With an average income of about $42,000 a year, many Koreans now find they have to borrow to keep up. Fueled by low interest rates, household debt in South Korea has grown significantly in recent years, and is now equal to the country\u2019s annual GDP. (In the U.S., by contrast, household debt is about 80 percent of GDP.) People may rack up debt because of credit card spending, unemployment or gambling losses, but a large chunk of it is tied to real estate. Housing prices have been rising fast, especially under President Moon Jae-in, and the average price of an apartment in Seoul is nearing $1 million. Lending curbs and efforts to cool the housing market have done little to rein in household borrowing. In addition to housing, some Koreans, especially young people, borrow money to invest in cryptocurrency. Many Koreans start out by borrowing from legitimate financial institutions like banks, said Koo Se-Woong, a commentator on Korean culture based in Germany. When that avenue is exhausted, they may move on to second-tier lenders that charge higher interest. In the worst-case scenarios, he said, borrowers turn to loan shark operations that can charge triple-digit interest rates, \u201cand then you are pushed into situations from which you really cannot get out.\u201d According to some estimates, there are 400,000 Koreans in debt to loan sharks. \u201cWhen you look at the characters in the show who are participating in this game, they represent that demographic of the Koreans who are in the worst possible situation because of their personal debt,\u201d Koo said. In a recent widely shared Facebook post, Koo said he was shocked when a friend told him he was living paycheck to paycheck, despite having a good job. The friend \u201cdoesn't strike anyone as extravagant,\u201d Koo said, but struggles to afford the trappings of middle-class life: an apartment, a car and occasional travel with his wife and children. \"It's all paid for by loans, I am telling you,\" Koo said his friend told him. \"We just have no money.\" Jung, the security analyst, said the plot of \u201cSquid Game\u201d was easy to accept because \u201cit dealt with such familiar stories of debt-ridden people you come across in real life.\u201d \u201cThe story stems from a deeply rooted perception of how society looks at failure, especially individual financial failure,\u201d he said. Bankruptcy in South Korea is generally seen not as a chance to start over but as a devastating fate. That is underlined in \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Saeji said, when contestants are given the option to leave but choose to keep playing even at the risk of their lives. \u201cIn the regular world it\u2019s not just the death of their body, it\u2019s the death of their pride. It\u2019s the shame of having to be such an unsuccessful person in front of your family,\u201d she said. Viewers in South Korea say the show is all the more disturbing because it injects death and violence into playground games like Red Light, Green Light and tug of war. The show plays on childhood nostalgia \u201cand along with it the innocent times when you had no problems,\u201d said Kim Hern-sik, a pop culture critic in Seoul. \u201cYet the story tells you that escaping from reality is not the answer.\u201d \u201cSquid Game\u201d is \u201cfundamentally a Korean story, featuring games people would remember playing as kids,\u201d Don Kang, vice president of Korean content at Netflix, told NBC News in an email. \u201cSo we knew it would resonate with our members here.\u201d Its popularity in the West came as more of a surprise. But Korean cultural exports have been sweeping Asia for years, and Netflix was already betting on their growing appeal. The company is spending $500 million this year on Korean content, almost as much as it spent in the last five years. Saeji said that after decades of Western cultural influence, the success of \u201cSquid Game\u201d shows that South Korea can make a TV show with a Hollywood feel \u201cand they can do it better.\u201d While \u201cSquid Game\u201d is not the first story about a fight to the death, director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who has a film degree from the University of Southern California, made it influential in his own way, said Oh Dong-jin, a prominent film critic in South Korea. \u201cEvery movie borrows this and that from other movies. What matters, therefore, is how creatively you can borrow from different references,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, even from this standpoint, the traditional children\u2019s games the show uses make 'Squid Game' quite original.\u201d Margie Kim, a housewife in Seoul who is watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d with her family, said that while she enjoyed its intensity and pop-art-influenced visuals, the underlying messages were also important. \u201cI do feel the pain of what our society is going through,\u201d she said. The show deals with so many pressing issues, she said\u2014income inequality, youth unemployment, a rapidly aging society\u2014that it\u2019s something her entire family can relate to and talk about. \u201cSo many middle-class, ordinary people live with so much debt,\u201d she said. \u201cI could totally empathize with people who joined the game.\u201d Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Stella Kim reported from Los Angeles.", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/working-companies-owned-well-heeled-private-equity-firms-can-mean-n1281146", "title": "Working for companies owned by well-heeled private-equity firms can mean lower wages for employees", "subtitle": "Workers at some fast-food chains owned by public firms are getting better wages now. It\u2019s a different story at restaurants owned by private-equity firms.", "author": "By Gretchen Morgenson", "section": null, "body": "Alma Jordan, a certified nursing assistant at the Marcella Center nursing home in Burlington, New Jersey, respected the residents she cared for there over the past 16 years. They were like family, she said, and she believes they\u2019ve appreciated her attentiveness, especially during Covid-19. Not so, the nursing home\u2019s new owner, Jordan said. After Complete Care Management, the largest for-profit nursing home operator in New Jersey, took over the 150-bed Marcella Center in April, it slashed worker benefits, she and other employees as well as a representative from their union told NBC News. Amid the pandemic, Jordan\u2019s paid holidays were reduced, and her monthly health insurance costs more than tripled, she said. The company stopped contributing to the employee pension, replacing it with a 401(k) plan that had no employer match or contribution. Complete Care took away vision insurance and stopped a reimbursement program covering employee education costs, so Jordan, 45, won\u2019t be able to recoup money she spent working toward a degree to become a licensed practical nurse. \u201cI put all my effort into this company, and someone else took over and they don\u2019t want to give us what we deserve,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s business. It\u2019s not about the staff and the residents. It\u2019s only about making profits.\u201d In late September, Jordan quit her position at the facility. The reduced benefits and deteriorating work conditions got to be too much, she said. When Complete Care came in, Jordan and other Marcella workers were operating under a union contract struck with the facility\u2019s previous owner. Complete Care did away with that contract, which also covered four other unionized New Jersey nursing facilities it recently acquired, according to the Service Employees International Union. Complete Care owns 61 facilities in eight states, including Connecticut, Maryland and Wisconsin. It is backed by a private-equity firm called Peace Capital in Lakewood, New Jersey, whose principal owner is Sam Stein. Jordan and her fellow workers are not alone in experiencing reduced circumstances after their company is taken over by a private-equity firm. The new titans of finance, these firms use large pools of debt \u2014 typically raised in what's called the leveraged loan market \u2014 to acquire companies they hope to resell in a few years at a profit. Among companies raising money in this loan market during the past three years, debt levels at private-equity-backed entities were at least 30 percent higher than debt levels at companies not backed by private equity, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. But the heavy debt loads they take on, combined with pressure to flip acquired companies quickly, increases the likelihood that private-equity firms will have to cut costs in the operations that they buy. Often, the first to the chopping block is the company\u2019s workforce. A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research lays this out. Researchers analyzed almost 10,000 debt-fueled buyouts between 1980 and 2013 and found that employment fell by 13 percent when a private-equity firm took over a public company. Employment declined by even more \u2014 16 percent \u2014 when private equity acquired a unit or division of a company. Eileen Appelbaum is an economist and co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, and co-author of \"Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street.\" Her study of private equity has led her to conclude that the industry\u2019s growing clout is not only a concern for workers, but also has the potential to harm the nation\u2019s broader economy. \u201cYou have a lot more ownership of productive resources by investors who don\u2019t know an industry, don\u2019t understand the value of skilled workers and who are just in it to make their profit and get out,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cThat erodes productivity.\u201d Almost 12 million employees, or roughly 7 percent of the U.S. labor force, work for private-equity-backed businesses, according to the American Investment Council, an industry lobbying group. These companies generated about 6.5 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product last year, the group said. The council said private-equity firms create jobs, support businesses and help provide comfortable retirements for pensioners invested in the strategy. A spokeswoman for Complete Care echoed this view. She said the company is committed to the long-term viability of its facilities, adding in a statement: \u201cWe offer a comprehensive health plan and competitive benefits, and our facilities are known as great places to work.\u201d The company is negotiating a new union contract, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, though, care at the Marcella facility is declining, Jordan said, days after she quit. \u201cWe were very short-staffed,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think the residents pick up on that because it takes longer to answer a call.\u201d In a statement, a spokesperson for Complete Care said, \u201cComplete Care at Marcella consistently maintains state mandated ratios. ... We take whatever measures necessary to ensure that we have proper staffing to meet the needs of those in our care, including bringing in agency staff and offering bonuses as needed.\" Private equity is a sophisticated investment strategy that has grown furiously in recent years. At the end of last year, assets under management at the firms worldwide stood at $5 trillion, up from $1.5 trillion over the past decade, according to Preqin, a financial data provider. The number of funds devoted to these activities has more than doubled during that period, and last year, private-equity firms paid some $600 billion to acquire companies, up from $250 billion 10 years earlier. Private-equity firms began their climb to power in the 1980s; then they were known as leveraged buyout shops, because of the debt they use. The $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988 by private-equity giant Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts brought such deals to center stage. In recent years, as prevailing interest rates collapsed, private-equity operations have been able to take on greater amounts of low-cost debt to make their acquisitions. Through Sept. 27, for example, $472 billion of leveraged loans were issued, up from $237 billion issued during the same period in 2019, according to LCD of S&P Global. Outside investors, such as public pension funds and endowments, pour money into these takeover deals in the hopes of generating high returns. But recently, as the stock market has roared, outsize returns in private equity have all but vanished, academic studies show, and they are now in line with overall market performance. Nevertheless, more companies are owned by private-equity firms now than trade on the nation\u2019s stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, private-equity firms\u2019 rising dominance has generated immense wealth for their executives. The value of Sam Stein's holdings in Complete Care could not be determined and the company declined to provide it, but it is almost certainly dwarfed by those of Stephen Schwarzman, head of Blackstone Group. A close adviser to Donald Trump during his presidency, Schwarzman is worth $35 billion, according to Forbes magazine, up from $15 billion in 2020. Private equity also benefited from recent government interventions related to the Covid pandemic, documents show. At least $5 billion in federal bailout money went to companies backed by large and well-capitalized private-equity firms, according to a recent report from Americans for Financial Reform. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board launched an unprecedented $750 billion program to prop up the corporate bond market, where many of these firms raise money for their buyouts. Among the bonds purchased by the Fed, documents show, were those issued by Blackstone and another private-equity giant, Apollo Global Management, founded by Leon Black. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently testified that the agency would increase its scrutiny on fee disclosures and conflicts of interest among private funds, to ensure their practices don't put investors in these strategies at a disadvantage. And Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a late September memo outlining the agency's priorities that \"the growing role of private equity\" invites an examination of how these firms' business models \"may facilitate unfair methods of competition and consumer protection violations.\" Finally, the Democrats\u2019 proposed tax increase on capital gains may crimp private-equity executives\u2019 earnings. A key reason many of these executives have been able to amass such fortunes is that so much of their earnings are taxed as capital gains with a top rate of 20 percent, not at the higher 37 percent rate that can apply to income. This is a benefit they've tapped for decades, often allowing them to pay a lower tax rate on earnings than a secretary or a teacher might. One of the nation\u2019s biggest private-equity employers is Roark Capital of Atlanta. It owns Inspire Brands \u2014 parent company to an array of fast-food chains that includes Arby\u2019s, Dunkin\u2019, Baskin-Robbins and Sonic \u2014 and other brands such as Cinnabon and Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee. NBC News estimates that more than 700,000 people work at Inspire Brands, many at independently owned franchise stores. Roark is named for the libertarian protagonist in \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d by Ayn Rand, whose life \u201cexemplified the qualities of independence and integrity,\u201d the company\u2019s website said. One of libertarianism's basic tenets is limited government, but three dozen companies owned by Roark obtained $183 million in federal assistance under the CARES Act, according to the Americans for Financial Reform report. Asked whether this acceptance of government funding ran counter to a limited government stance, Roark declined to comment through a spokeswoman. Zella Roberts, a recent graduate of Warren Wilson College near Asheville, North Carolina, worked as a carhop at a Sonic Drive-In earlier this year to help pay tuition. Her all-in pay plummeted during the pandemic, Roberts told NBC News, because customers\u2019 cash usage fell and Sonic did not allow tips on credit cards. Roberts said she and some colleagues sent an email to Roark Capital \"explaining the conditions that Sonic workers experience. The big ask was to put pressure on Sonic corporate to make these changes.\" She said she never heard back about that or other messages sent to Neal Aronson, managing partner and founder of Roark Capital. Aronson is the controlling owner of Roark, regulatory filings show, which has $18.6 billion in assets under management. Through a spokeswoman, Aronson declined to comment. In January, after Roberts had collected 7,800 signatures on a petition asking Roark to change its policy, the company allowed tips on credit card orders placed through its app. An improvement, Roberts acknowledged, but such orders are a small percentage of those made via credit cards, she pointed out. The Inspire Brands spokesman said barring tips on credit cards \u201cis a technology limitation that we inherited when we purchased the brand\u201d in 2018. \u201cWe are now working on implementing the credit card tipping capability,\u201d he said. Inspire Brands has also worked to battle the Raise the Wage Act, which has been introduced in Congress every year since 2017 and would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour among workers like Roberts. In March, Inspire sent a memo to franchise owners highlighting its lobbying success in opposing the change. Describing its efforts, Inspire said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you\u2019re on the menu, and you can guarantee your opponents are eating!\u201d Chris Fuller, a spokesman for Inspire Brands, said the company fought the national minimum wage legislation because \u201cwe don\u2019t support a one-size-fits-all approach to the minimum wage. We believe in letting the local markets dictate.\u201d He added: \u201cMore than 90 percent of our team members at corporate-owned restaurants are above the state or local minimum wage.\u201d Some Inspire Brands workers have taken matters into their own hands. This summer, Matthew Honeycutt, 18, was working at an Arby\u2019s in Charlotte, North Carolina, making $9.50 an hour as a shift manager. He supports an 8-month-old son. On July 20, he and a group of workers walked off the job seeking a pay raise, forcing managers to close the Arby\u2019s store two hours early, Honeycutt said. That got management\u2019s attention, he said. \u201cThe strike was on a Tuesday, and it was about Thursday when he started getting the raises out,\u201d Honeycutt said of his boss, who gave him a 50-cents-an-hour raise. \"Every kind of worker you can think of is working so hard, but they're not getting paid what they\u2019re worth.\" Honeycutt\u2019s boss did not respond to a voicemail message seeking comment. In mid-September, Honeycutt quit his job at Arby's for a higher-paying position elsewhere. While Inspire Brands fights against a higher minimum wage, some other restaurant companies owned by publicly traded companies are taking a different approach. They say increasing worker pay is good for business. In February, Robert Verostek, the chief financial officer of restaurant chain Denny\u2019s, told investors that paying a higher wage to its workers in California had resulted in \u201cnot just positive sales, but positive guest traffic.\u201d And in May, McDonald's began increasing pay by 10 percent for almost 37,000 workers in company-owned stores. Shift managers like Honeycutt, who earned $10 at Arby\u2019s, are earning between $15 and $20 an hour depending on the location, McDonald\u2019s said. Sean Dunlop, an equity analyst at Morningstar Research, said Inspire Brands is a well-managed company. But increasing pay and benefits among workers is an industry trend it won't be able to resist. \"As you\u2019re thinking about bigger chains, not only are they making a broader push to a $15 average wage at restaurants, you\u2019ve also seen them offer tuition assistance, paid time off, retention bonuses and referral bonuses as they\u2019ve been trying to attract workers,\" Dunlop said. \"Inspire Brands, if they want to compete, are going to be forced to raise wages. They're going to have to, whether they want to or not.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/silicon-valley-area-food-banks-strain-under-growing-logistical-needs-n1281047", "title": "Silicon Valley area food banks strain under growing logistical needs of poverty", "subtitle": "\u201cInfrastructure requirements have sorely taxed the charitable food system at a time when demand is still extraordinarily high,\u201d one expert said.", "author": "By Cyrus Farivar", "section": null, "body": "RICHMOND, Calif. \u2014 On a recent unseasonably warm October day, dozens of Californians gathered at a food distribution site on a vast, unshaded blacktop space behind an elementary school. In one hour, 193 people waited patiently to fill their carts and shopping bags with produce like bell peppers, apples, onions and squash from the side of a massive truck. \u201cThat\u2019s a record for this year,\u201d said Matthew Durkin, 30, the mobile distribution supervisor, while nodding at the clients and noting that he usually sees only about 160 people. \u201cIt means there\u2019s an increased need.\u201d Durkin, of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, says that while demand for free food has slowed slightly from the start of the pandemic, people are still hungry. \u201cWe have seen another jump in numbers within the last few months. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, adding that many clients have told them how much they fear returning to work. \"They are concerned about Covid-19 surges, as so many of us are, and some of them may need to stay available for unexpected changes in child care and school due to Covid exposures or cases.\u201d More than 18 months into the pandemic, San Francisco Bay Area nonprofit organizations, from food banks to shelters for domestic violence victims, say that they are seeing more demand for their services than they ever saw before the pandemic. Even now, there are still two members of the California National Guard working at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties\u2019 central warehouse in Fairfield. As the pandemic drags on, these support facilities are also struggling with supply chain problems to meet the seemingly endless demand. It presents even more challenges as supplies and workers grow more scarce. Joel Sjostrom, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, has watched the food bank\u2019s demand grow to 300,000 people at the height of the pandemic from 178,000 before the pandemic began. He is now still trying to find support for 240,000 clients each month. Almost immediately after the March 2020 shelter-in-place order was instituted, he said, his organization lost 35 percent of its volunteer workforce because it depends so heavily on older volunteers who were scared to work before they were vaccinated. He had to call in members of the California National Guard, two of which remain. \u201cTo meet those volume increases, we have had to step up facilities and transportation,\u201d Sjostrom added. \u201cI had heard of the National Guard being helpful to others in Southern California.\u201d At one point, there were as many as 25 soldiers working to help this one bank. In California, the National Guard, as of Thursday, still had 140 soldiers deployed to food banks across 16 counties, down from a high of 767 in April 2020, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan M. Shiroma, a California National Guard spokesperson. But the National Guard is gradually trying to cut those numbers back and deploy these workers to other missions. In addition to help from the National Guard, Sjostrom has hired more full-time staff. But even now, even with 16 drivers, he still would like four more \u201cClass A\u201d drivers who can operate big rig trucks. In order to stay competitive with other outfits that employ drivers, he said he has had to raise his rates from $28 per hour to $30 per hour. \u201cIt\u2019s truly market pressure,\u201d Sjostrom said. \u201cAmazon has ads out, as does Hello Fresh, and driver demand is everywhere.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/traffic-stops-are-flashpoint-policing-america-reformers-are-winning-big-n1280594", "title": "Police face a 'crisis of trust' with Black motorists.

Police chiefs aren't happy.", "author": "By Simone Weichselbaum, Emily R. Siegel and Andrew Blankstein", "section": null, "body": "In the months after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, public defenders in Virginia saw an opportunity to overhaul policing in the state. Among their key priorities to address racial disparities: a ban on traffic stops for such infractions as broken taillights, tinted windows and the aroma of marijuana. What happened next stunned police officials across Virginia. In just three months, the ban the public defenders pitched to Democratic legislators sailed to the governor\u2019s desk and was signed into law. With Covid-19 shutting down the state Capitol and forcing the legislative sessions to take place via Zoom, the law enforcement officials who objected to the bill had failed to galvanize the opposition. In March, Virginia became the first state to prohibit the kind of low-level traffic stops that disproportionately affect people of color and are often used as pretexts to search for drugs and weapons. An NBC News analysis of the early data shows that the measure is having an impact on the percentage of Black motorists searched by police during traffic stops. \u201cAs public defenders, we aren\u2019t exactly used to winning, let alone winning big,\u201d said Brad Haywood, the chief public defender for Arlington County and executive director of Justice Forward, a criminal justice reform organization made up of public defenders across the state. \u201cThis will dramatically reduce race-based policing and impact so many lives.\u201d Long a cornerstone of American law enforcement, the traffic stop has emerged as a flashpoint in the debate over police reform. Over the last 20 months, district attorneys in California and Minnesota have ordered prosecutors to drop cases in which officers found guns or drugs during traffic stops for minor infractions. Other states, including Washington and Massachusetts, are considering restrictions similar to Virginia\u2019s. Proponents describe the measures as a long overdue step in banishing a tactic that targets mainly Black drivers and fails to improve public safety. But many law enforcement officials argue that they\u2019re being stripped of a crucial tool that they say helps to reduce vehicle deaths and remove criminals, guns and drugs from the streets, although the police chiefs and sheriffs interviewed for this article struggled to provide data backing up their case. Maggie DeBoard, the chief of the Herndon Police Department in Virginia, said stripping police of the ability to make certain traffic stops will make the roads more susceptible to traffic accidents and create fewer opportunities for officers to encounter people who should be off the streets. \u201cWe are eliminating more and more interactions with criminals by not allowing us to enforce the laws that are on the books,\u201d said DeBoard, who was the president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police as the group fought the bill. \u201cA lot of times you stop a vehicle, you have no idea the race, color, creed, religion of the person you're stopping,\u201d DeBoard said. \u201cYou see a violation, you stop the car. And at night, you definitely don\u2019t know who you\u2019re stopping. So it is not about targeting.\u201d Virginia started collecting detailed traffic stop statistics only in June 2020. The early data suggest that the law is having some effect on how the roads are policed. In the first four months after the law was enacted \u2014 March to June \u2014 the number of overall traffic stops rose by 7 percent compared to the previous four months, which experts said isn\u2019t surprising given that warmer weather tends to attract more drivers to the roads. But the number of motorists subjected to searches after having been pulled over \u2014 the category that the reformers care about most \u2014 dropped sharply, according to an NBC News analysis of police data obtained in a public records request. The number of Black drivers who were searched fell by 40 percent, and the number of white drivers dropped by 30 percent, the data show. Black people still accounted for about 30 percent of all traffic stops \u2014 the same percentage as before the law was changed \u2014 even though they are about 20 percent of the population of Virginia. White people, who make up 65 percent of the population, accounted for slightly under 65 percent of the stops before and after the law was changed, the early data show. Da\u2019Quan Marcell Love, the executive director of the Virginia NAACP, said the decline in the number of searches of Black drivers shows that the reforms are broadly working. But he said advocates are waiting to see how the situation plays out in the long term. \u201cWe have to give it time to work,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe are not launching a celebration any time soon.\u201d Officers stop about 20 million drivers a year, according to federal estimates, for reasons from speeding to blowing through reds light to expired tags. The vast majority of the encounters last only a few minutes and result in tickets or warnings, research shows. Police across the country have long been criticized for using minor infractions such as broken taillights as reasons to stop motorists and investigate them for possible crimes. Criminologists and civil rights lawyers have panned the tactic as a fishing expedition rife with racial bias that yields few results. Frank Baumgartner, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed more than 24 million traffic stops across North Carolina from 2002 to 2020. He found that the encounters led to arrests about 2 percent of the time. Searches also rarely occurred, and when they did, weapons were discovered in one-tenth of 1 percent of incidents. Black people were the subjects of nearly half the stops, Baumgartner found, even though they are only 21 percent of the state\u2019s population. \u201cFor every one bad guy they catch, they alienate, like, 18 young Black men,\u201d Baumgartner said. \u201cThat's where we get to the crisis of trust with the police.\u201d That type of traffic stop led to two of the highest-profile police killings in recent years: those of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Both were Black men who were shot and killed by officers after having been pulled over for broken taillights. Officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder of Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked coast-to-coast calls for reform. Faced with overwhelming public pressure, elected officials are increasingly moving forward with measures to strip away police powers regardless of whether law enforcement leaders support them. Last month, the top prosecutor in Ramsey County, Minnesota, where Castile was killed, announced that he would no longer prosecute  most cases that stem from non-public-safety traffic stops, such as expired tags. He cited the disproportionate impact on people of color, especially Black people, among other reasons. \u201cThe outcome of these stops is that it yields very, very little contraband,\u201d said the prosecutor, County Attorney John Choi. \u201cIf I thought that this would lead to more problems from a public safety perspective, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Larger police departments in Choi\u2019s county supported the move, but the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association described it as \u201cinsulting.\u201d More statewide bans may be on the horizon as politicians continue to openly shrug off opposition from police. Inspired by the change in Virginia\u2019s law, Joe Nguyen, a Democratic state senator in Washington, recently introduced legislation that would prohibit police from pulling motorists over for failing to stop, driving without licenses and other violations. \u201cWe passed a few bills last year that didn\u2019t have law enforcement support, so it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of,\u201d Nguyen said. Some police chiefs across the country, in places like Oakland, California; Minneapolis; and Portland, Oregon, have retooled their traffic enforcement policies to avoid unnecessary confrontations with drivers. The Oakland Police Department issued a directive five years ago discouraging officers from pulling people over for low-level offenses like equipment violations and expired registrations. Since the policies were put in place, the percentage of Black drivers who were stopped fell from 62 percent in 2016 to 51 percent in 2019. The police department enlisted Stanford University to examine its data, which showed that under 3 percent of stops in 2013 and 2014 were linked to more serious crimes. Deputy Police Chief Christopher Bolton urged Oakland police brass reluctant to reform to take a hard look at the statistics. \u201cWhy are we continuing to do those stops when the data is showing that not only is it not effective and efficient, but it could very well be damaging public trust and confidence in what our strategies are?\u201d Bolton asked. But in San Francisco, District Attorney Chesa Boudin\u2019s push to end \u201cpretextual\u201d traffic stops has met fierce resistance from the police. During his second month in office, Boudin told staff members to refrain from prosecuting people who were stopped for minor infractions and found to have \u201ccontraband,\u201d including drugs and guns. Union officials slammed Boudin for creating an environment in which criminals feel comfortable to break the law without fear of punishment. \u201cIf they want to continue to handcuff the police in doing their jobs, the unintended consequences are going to be more crime victims,\u201d said Tony Montoya, the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Union officials blame Boudin\u2019s new traffic policy for the release of a man who was accused of fatally shooting two people weeks after he was pulled over and found with an assault-style rifle without a serial number. The district attorney\u2019s office said its decision not to pursue charges against the suspect, Robert Newt, had nothing to do with the circumstances of the stop. The investigators didn\u2019t provide DNA or fingerprints that could tie Newt to the gun, Boudin\u2019s office said. Rachel Marshall, a spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office, said the policy \u201coffers room for exceptions.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office said it has rejected about one to two cases a month because of Boudin\u2019s rules, for a total of 11 this year. \u201cRacial profiling undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and fosters distrust in communities of color \u2014 all of which decreases public safety,\u201d Marshall said. Police chiefs and sheriffs in Virginia say that the state\u2019s ban went too far and that it is putting lives at risk at a time when murders and fatal accidents are already soaring. The original bill, in fact, would have gone even further by blocking police from stopping vehicles with no front lights. The governor\u2019s office cut the measure after Chesterfield County Police Chief Jeffrey Katz blasted it in a viral Facebook post. The new law permits a driver to have one broken headlight. \u201cLawmakers were making decisions based on the loudest voices in the room, but not necessarily the most informed voices in the room,\u201d Katz said in an interview. \u201cAnd all you have to do is look at the crime rate in the last year and a half.\u201d As in many other states, the number of murders in Virginia has risen sharply since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Virginia State Police. Even though officers can still cite people for speeding and erratic driving, rural county sheriffs said the ban creates an atmosphere in which reckless motorists feel safe to break the law, and they warned that traffic deaths will rise. Fatal traffic accidents in the six months after the law was changed hit a 10-year high, according to an NBC News analysis that compared them to the same period going back to 2011. Jessica Cowardin, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said the rise in traffic deaths mirrors national figures, which are also up. Federal officials blame the increase on speeding, drunk drivers and people who don\u2019t wear seat belts \u2014 violations that police in Virginia can still enforce. For some Virginia police chiefs, the concerns go beyond traffic accidents. In Petersburg, about 20 miles south of Richmond, officers confiscated more than 1,000 guns in the three years leading up to the ban, often in vehicle stops, Police Chief Travis Christian said. But his office was unable to provide data backing up the claim. The analysis of arrest data found that weapons were discovered in about 7 percent of traffic stops in Petersburg from 2018 to 2020. As a chief who is Black, Christian said he is \u201ctorn\u201d over the new law. He acknowledged that Black Virginians feel targeted by police when they are behind the wheel, but he said he still wants the ban reversed. \u201cIt has given us the ability to use it as an investigative tool to get to other crimes that have been committed,\u201d Christian said. \u201cThat tool has been eliminated for us.\u201d David Weisburd, a criminology professor and the executive director of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, said he wasn\u2019t aware of any data that support the claim that low-level traffic stops help to reduce crime. \u201cIt is time, in my view, for the police to bring evidence to their arguments,\u201d Weisburd said. \u201cThat evidence could help in deciding what is reasonable or unreasonable or what is good policing from what is awful policing.\u201d The new law hasn\u2019t put an end to controversial stops in Virginia. Five days after the ban went into effect, state troopers pulled over Juanisha Brooks, 35, a Black woman who is a senior video producer for the Defense Department, as she was driving along a highway in Northern Virginia. A trooper ordered her to get out of the vehicle several times, saying he wanted to show her what was wrong with her car. Brooks refused, saying she didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t tell her while she remained in the vehicle. Dashcam video appears to show the trooper dragging Brooks out of the seat and pushing her up against her car. Officers charged her with reckless driving, eluding, obstruction of justice and failing to have her headlights on. Prosecutors dropped the case, noting that the stop was illegal because of the reforms. Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, insisted that the arrest was fair because Brooks refused to comply with the trooper\u2019s commands. State Police conducted an internal investigation; Geller said she couldn\u2019t share whether the trooper was disciplined because of privacy rules. \u201cI was afraid for my life,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be another hashtag.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ems-services-warn-crippling-labor-shortage-undermining-911-system-rcna2677", "title": "EMS services warn of 'crippling labor shortage' undermining 911 system", "subtitle": "\u201cWe\u2019re not bleeding any longer \u2014 we\u2019re hemorrhaging,\u201d one ambulance service operator said of a decadelong worker shortage exacerbated by the pandemic.", "author": "By Phil McCausland", "section": null, "body": "The pandemic-induced shortage of emergency medical technicians and paramedics nationwide is so dire that ambulance service providers warn of sharp cuts to services and longer waits for 911 calls \u2014 even when it\u2019s a matter of life or death. Companies have had to close, consolidate or come up with new strategies to answer calls, said American Ambulance Association President Shawn Baird, who added that there is simply not enough EMS personnel to cover calls in many parts of the country, especially during the pandemic. The loss of staff to pandemic-related burnout and low wages has created a vicious cycle, requiring greater dependence on those workers who have stayed on. The situation has deteriorated to such a degree in recent months that ambulance services and industry leaders are pleading with Congress and state legislatures to help. \"The magnitude has really blown up over the last few months,\" Baird said. \"When you take a system that was already fragile and stretched it, because you didn't have enough people entering the field, then you throw a public health emergency and all of the additional burdens that it put on our workforce as well as the labor shortages across the entire economy, and it really has put us in a crisis mode.\" It's a crisis that has made it difficult to hire and even harder to retain EMTs and paramedics, according to a AAA survey of 258 EMS organizations across the country. In 2020, nearly a third of the workforce left their ambulance company after less than a year, the survey said. Eleven percent left within the first three months. \"It's almost unmanageable,\" said Ken Cummings, who leads Tri-Hospital EMS in Port Huron, Michigan. \"I don't think any EMS provider wants to go out in public and say that your service might be interrupted, but the reality is that because of the extremely low workforce situation right now, we are going to start to see delays. We're already seeing that throughout the country right now.\" Cummings said he currently has 10 openings, about 10 percent of his workforce. He's currently paying double overtime to fill the gap left by those empty positions, but that has increased the average work week of his paramedics by at least eight hours. The amount of money he's paying in overtime is also becoming untenable, and his workers are losing interest in the extra cash. \"We're spending money today that we're hoping we get tomorrow, to be real honest with you,\" he said. \"It's not a long-term solution.\" There are an estimated 1,000 open EMS positions in Michigan alone, Cummings said. The good news for Cummings is that he has a handful of students who will graduate next year from the paramedic program, but the churn is constant. The Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, also agreed to allocate $12.9 million of the state's budget to increase reimbursement rates. But that has not slowed the revolving-door nature of the job. Among full-time EMTs, 47 percent reported in 2020 that the reason for leaving was for a career or occupation change, according to the survey. That number is 45 percent among paramedics. \"In my experience running an EMS service, I've seen more than a few employees get into the industry and leave within six months,\" said Judd Smith, the program director of Texas EMS School in Abilene. \"I'll see people work for three weeks and then move on to the next thing.\" The decline in Texas has been particularly substantial. By mid-August, only 27 percent of licensed EMS professionals had submitted a patient care record, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, meaning that over 70 percent of licensed Texas EMTs did not work on an ambulance in the first eight months of the year. That represents a significant drop from the 43 percent of EMTs who submitted reports in 2020 and the 45 percent who did in 2019. The circumstances have pushed the American Ambulance Association and National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians to send a letter to Congress last week pushing for a hearing to address the shortfall and asking for more funding to increase wages. The letter warned that \"our nation\u2019s EMS system is facing a crippling workforce shortage, a long-term problem that has been building for more than a decade. It threatens to undermine our emergency 9-1-1 infrastructure and deserves urgent attention by the Congress.\" The pandemic has made a bad labor problem worse. The spread of the virus, the frequency of calls, worry of potential infection and the necessary safeguards that emergency personnel must take to protect themselves have created additional stress that has caused many to leave the field, providers said. Their departure has then increased the need for those who remain to work overtime, pushing even more to leave the field. The nationwide health emergency also caused many EMT and paramedic courses to shut down, meaning there is a dearth of students coming into the industry. \"We're not bleeding any longer \u2014 we're hemorrhaging,\" said Gary Wadaga, who operates Bay Ambulance in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Ambulance companies have faced years of workforce challenges that has damaged their ability to respond to calls quickly, but the situation is getting worse. Last year, because an ambulance service closed south of his company's service area, Wadaga had to take on an additional 100 square miles of territory. Now he covers 1,500 square miles and receives about 1,000 calls a year with six paramedic positions. The trouble is, he's been unable to fill two spots and has another two workers on leave, leaving him and one other person to respond to every emergency call that comes in. \"I've not seen it this bad in 41 years, and you can't just set that aside,\" said Wadaga, adding that the increasing demands of the job have caused him great anxiety. \"You want to be there for your community, but the fact that one day we're not going to have enough people absolutely bothers me.\" Ambulance companies once had the luxury of considering applicants, but that appears to be a concept of the past. Now companies are actively recruiting and even going after one another's employees because the pool of eligible workers is so small. \"Overall, it's robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Baird, \"because every community needs these folks.\" Wadaga and other ambulance service operators said the pandemic has increased the viciousness of a labor shortage and put the nation's emergency medical system at risk of a \"death spiral\" that could be difficult to pull out of. The salary requests of a shrinking workforce are getting higher as wages remain stagnant. The 2020 median pay for EMTs and paramedics was $36,650 per year or $17.62 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about a 7.5 percent increase since 2011. Advocates said the wages don't match the requirements of the job anymore. \"When you're an EMS provider putting your life on the line and entering into a closed environments with infectious patients and you can make more money to work in an Amazon warehouse, it becomes really difficult to retain people,\" said Robert Luckritz, who serves as chair of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians' EMS Workforce Committee. But it's not just retail and warehouse work that's calling. Luckritz said that hospitals facing their own nursing and health care worker shortages are at times actively recruiting EMT and paramedics, promising higher wages, better hours and increased benefits. That's an issue Luckritz and his colleagues are attempting to work on, but it's a challenge. They need more money to hire more people, but ambulance company rates are set by insurance providers and the government when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, which both contribute to the vast majority of calls, Luckritz said. \"Unlike much of the other industries across the country ... we're not able to raise our prices \u2014 our prices are set by the government,\" he said. \"So with reimbursement not keeping up with our costs, it makes it very difficult for us to compete for the workforce.\" The fear is that if the country doesn't face these problems now, they will be unfixable down the line. Baird, the AAA president, said that if things spiral too far down, \"we can\u2019t get people to even enter the field because it looks too daunting.\" \"We have to turn this around,\" he said. One silver lining is that online EMS programs, such as Smith's Texas EMS School, are seeing increased interest \u2014 even as nationwide there is a decline in enrollment in traditional programs. The number of applications for their EMT program, which can be completed in 10 to 18 weeks via a mix of online coursework and hands-on clinical and field experience, jumped from 495 applicants in 2019 to 1,469 in 2021. The jobs certainly are there waiting for them at graduation. \"I don't know of any one of our students that doesn't get hired within the first week of getting licensed,\" Smith said. \"We've even had a big number of them get hired before they even received their certification, so they start working as soon as they're done.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-stake-2022-hopes-child-cash-benefits-there-s-just-n1281142", "title": "Democrats stake 2022 hopes on child cash benefits.

But in doing so, they planted an election-year time bomb for their own party, and their only realistic hope of defusing it in time is to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s social spending bill. At the center of the American Rescue Plan is a monthly payment structured as a tax credit for the vast majority of families \u2014 of $300 per child under 6 years old or $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. The benefit has been well received in polls, and studies say it quickly lifted millions of U.S. kids out of poverty. But there\u2019s a catch: It is only authorized for 2021. The payments end in December unless extended. With Republicans opposed, the only realistic vehicle to extend them is Biden\u2019s multitrillion-dollar bill, which Democratic leaders are working feverishly to craft. Allowing the payments to expire would risk erasing the economic gains and leaving struggling parents who have come to rely on it in the lurch. Democratic operatives warn it could turn a significant political asset into a liability just months before an election in which Republicans are historically favored to make gains. \u201cLetting the extremely popular child care tax credit expire would be exactly the type of mistake we can\u2019t afford,\u201d Tyler Law, a Democratic consultant who worked for the party\u2019s House election arm during the 2018 blue wave, said. \u201cDemocrats need to deliver win after win after win to show voters we can govern and deserve to stay in power,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet for success, but there\u2019s certainly a recipe for disaster: failing to pass the Biden agenda.\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the child tax credit has had a major impact in alleviating poverty and held it up as an example that says Democrats, when in charge, can help Americans. \u201cThe idea of letting it expire, I think, would be horrific,\u201d he said. While Democrats battle over what provisions make it into the bill, they appear to agree unanimously that the money for kids should be extended \u2014 from centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., to progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. But the details are unclear. The House version of the bill extends the payments through 2025. That may be adjusted as lawmakers sort out how to cut down the plan's price tag to get the centrists on board. And the income threshold for who is eligible may be adjusted as Manchin has demanded additional means-testing for the various programs in the bill. \u201cThere's some differences of opinion about how to do it, and how long to fund it, etcetera. And it has to fit within the overall top line of the bill,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. \u201cBut every Dem really wants it to happen.\u201d Republicans are adamantly opposed to the program and say it should expire. \u201cThe federal government shouldn't be in the business of just handing out money because you have kids,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said. \u201cThat's ridiculous.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Democrats of \u201ctrying to build a permanent welfare class in the country,\u201d saying the child tax credit includes \u201cdistributing more borrowed money to people who don't have a need for it.\u201d Some Democrats are spoiling for that fight. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the party\u2019s House campaign arm, projected confidence that Democrats will pass the bill, extend the child cash payments and then run on them. \u201cWe're going to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact that the Republicans have opposed it at every step of the way will come back to haunt them. I believe that it's exactly that type of thing that is the anvil on which we will hammer them in 2022.\u201d Sean McElwee, a progressive pollster who has been cited by the White House, said his firm has found that voters who received the child cash payment approve of Biden's job performance by a wide margin of 66 percent to 32 percent, whereas voters who haven't gotten it split evenly with 49 percent approving and disapproving. The firm, Data for Progress, found that those who voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020 and who receive the child tax credit register 79 percent disapproval of Biden, whereas 92 percent of those who do not receive it disapprove of the president. \u201cEnding the child tax credit would risk washing away these key persuasion gains that will be necessary to win in 2022 and 2024,\u201d McElwee said. Overall, the child cash payments are supported by 59 percent of U.S. adults, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. That includes 75 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of Republicans. Some of the states with the highest average per-month cash payments are conservative states. Progressives cite the program as an example of how government can make Americans' lives better. \u201cWe already have powerful data showing us that this tax credit is reducing hunger in America. It's providing school shoes and backpacks for kids to be able to go back to school,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u201cWe need to protect this \u2014 not just because it expires in an election year.

Because everyone else is. The nine-episode horror series on Netflix has hit No. 1 in 90 of the streaming service\u2019s markets around the world, including South Korea, where it was made. \u201cI got to the point where I could not hold a conversation without watching the show,\u201d said Jung Dunn, a security analyst in Seoul, the South Korean capital. But the show also strikes a nerve because it unflinchingly addresses a problem that is particularly entrenched in South Korea: debt and the never-ending struggle to pay it off. The cast of \u201cSquid Game\u201d features some of South Korea\u2019s biggest stars, including Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist, Seong Gi-hun, a hopelessly indebted father who receives a business card from a stranger offering him a way out. Along with 455 other contestants \u2014 from all walks of life but all deeply in debt too \u2014 he agrees to compete for a cash prize of 45.6 billion won (about $38 million) by playing a series of traditional Korean children\u2019s games, only to discover that elimination from each round means death. \u201cThere\u2019s this dissonance between Korean pride that this Korean show is dominating Netflix all around the world, and the discomfort with what the show appears to expose about Korea,\u201d said CedarBough Saeji, an assistant professor of Korean and East Asian studies at Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea. \u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing.\u201d That South Korea also produced \u201cParasite,\u201d the 2020 Oscar winner for best picture that also focused on themes of inequality, has probably accentuated this discomfort, Saeji said. Still, \u201cSquid Game\u201d is wildly popular in its home country. The show was released on Sept. 17 just before Chuseok, a Korean holiday similar to Thanksgiving when families gather, the perfect time for binge-watching. The surge in network traffic led one internet service provider to sue Netflix to cover its costs. The fervor has also spilled over into real life. A street vendor in Seoul who provided the makers of \u201cSquid Game\u201d with dalgona, a brittle sugar candy at the center of one of the games, told Reuters that he had seen a boom in business. Thousands of curious South Koreans also tried the eight-digit phone number that appears on the business card, which the show\u2019s makers didn\u2019t realize would reach an actual person. The owner of the number, and even people with similar numbers, have been inundated with calls and messages at all hours. On Wednesday, Netflix said it was working with the show\u2019s local production company to address the issue, including editing scenes to remove the number. Park Sae-ha, a senior studying economics at Yonsei University in Seoul, said \u201cSquid Game\u201d was \u201cspell-binding because it was so explicit and blunt.\u201d \u201cAlthough I am young, I could easily relate to the hard reality of a very competitive society,\u201d she said. That intense competitiveness may be one reason South Korea has been so successful, with a period of rapid industrialization starting in the 1960s that turned it into the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. But as in many other countries, a university degree and a white-collar job don\u2019t guarantee the financial security they used to, Saeji said. With an average income of about $42,000 a year, many Koreans now find they have to borrow to keep up. Fueled by low interest rates, household debt in South Korea has grown significantly in recent years, and is now equal to the country\u2019s annual GDP. (In the U.S., by contrast, household debt is about 80 percent of GDP.) People may rack up debt because of credit card spending, unemployment or gambling losses, but a large chunk of it is tied to real estate. Housing prices have been rising fast, especially under President Moon Jae-in, and the average price of an apartment in Seoul is nearing $1 million. Lending curbs and efforts to cool the housing market have done little to rein in household borrowing. In addition to housing, some Koreans, especially young people, borrow money to invest in cryptocurrency. Many Koreans start out by borrowing from legitimate financial institutions like banks, said Koo Se-Woong, a commentator on Korean culture based in Germany. When that avenue is exhausted, they may move on to second-tier lenders that charge higher interest. In the worst-case scenarios, he said, borrowers turn to loan shark operations that can charge triple-digit interest rates, \u201cand then you are pushed into situations from which you really cannot get out.\u201d According to some estimates, there are 400,000 Koreans in debt to loan sharks. \u201cWhen you look at the characters in the show who are participating in this game, they represent that demographic of the Koreans who are in the worst possible situation because of their personal debt,\u201d Koo said. In a recent widely shared Facebook post, Koo said he was shocked when a friend told him he was living paycheck to paycheck, despite having a good job. The friend \u201cdoesn't strike anyone as extravagant,\u201d Koo said, but struggles to afford the trappings of middle-class life: an apartment, a car and occasional travel with his wife and children. \"It's all paid for by loans, I am telling you,\" Koo said his friend told him. \"We just have no money.\" Jung, the security analyst, said the plot of \u201cSquid Game\u201d was easy to accept because \u201cit dealt with such familiar stories of debt-ridden people you come across in real life.\u201d \u201cThe story stems from a deeply rooted perception of how society looks at failure, especially individual financial failure,\u201d he said. Bankruptcy in South Korea is generally seen not as a chance to start over but as a devastating fate. That is underlined in \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Saeji said, when contestants are given the option to leave but choose to keep playing even at the risk of their lives. \u201cIn the regular world it\u2019s not just the death of their body, it\u2019s the death of their pride. It\u2019s the shame of having to be such an unsuccessful person in front of your family,\u201d she said. Viewers in South Korea say the show is all the more disturbing because it injects death and violence into playground games like Red Light, Green Light and tug of war. The show plays on childhood nostalgia \u201cand along with it the innocent times when you had no problems,\u201d said Kim Hern-sik, a pop culture critic in Seoul. \u201cYet the story tells you that escaping from reality is not the answer.\u201d \u201cSquid Game\u201d is \u201cfundamentally a Korean story, featuring games people would remember playing as kids,\u201d Don Kang, vice president of Korean content at Netflix, told NBC News in an email. \u201cSo we knew it would resonate with our members here.\u201d Its popularity in the West came as more of a surprise. But Korean cultural exports have been sweeping Asia for years, and Netflix was already betting on their growing appeal. The company is spending $500 million this year on Korean content, almost as much as it spent in the last five years. Saeji said that after decades of Western cultural influence, the success of \u201cSquid Game\u201d shows that South Korea can make a TV show with a Hollywood feel \u201cand they can do it better.\u201d While \u201cSquid Game\u201d is not the first story about a fight to the death, director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who has a film degree from the University of Southern California, made it influential in his own way, said Oh Dong-jin, a prominent film critic in South Korea. \u201cEvery movie borrows this and that from other movies. What matters, therefore, is how creatively you can borrow from different references,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, even from this standpoint, the traditional children\u2019s games the show uses make 'Squid Game' quite original.\u201d Margie Kim, a housewife in Seoul who is watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d with her family, said that while she enjoyed its intensity and pop-art-influenced visuals, the underlying messages were also important. \u201cI do feel the pain of what our society is going through,\u201d she said. The show deals with so many pressing issues, she said\u2014income inequality, youth unemployment, a rapidly aging society\u2014that it\u2019s something her entire family can relate to and talk about. \u201cSo many middle-class, ordinary people live with so much debt,\u201d she said. \u201cI could totally empathize with people who joined the game.\u201d Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Stella Kim reported from Los Angeles.", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/working-companies-owned-well-heeled-private-equity-firms-can-mean-n1281146", "title": "Working for companies owned by well-heeled private-equity firms can mean lower wages for employees", "subtitle": "Workers at some fast-food chains owned by public firms are getting better wages now.

They were like family, she said, and she believes they\u2019ve appreciated her attentiveness, especially during Covid-19. Not so, the nursing home\u2019s new owner, Jordan said. After Complete Care Management, the largest for-profit nursing home operator in New Jersey, took over the 150-bed Marcella Center in April, it slashed worker benefits, she and other employees as well as a representative from their union told NBC News. Amid the pandemic, Jordan\u2019s paid holidays were reduced, and her monthly health insurance costs more than tripled, she said. The company stopped contributing to the employee pension, replacing it with a 401(k) plan that had no employer match or contribution. Complete Care took away vision insurance and stopped a reimbursement program covering employee education costs, so Jordan, 45, won\u2019t be able to recoup money she spent working toward a degree to become a licensed practical nurse. \u201cI put all my effort into this company, and someone else took over and they don\u2019t want to give us what we deserve,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s business. It\u2019s not about the staff and the residents. It\u2019s only about making profits.\u201d In late September, Jordan quit her position at the facility. The reduced benefits and deteriorating work conditions got to be too much, she said. When Complete Care came in, Jordan and other Marcella workers were operating under a union contract struck with the facility\u2019s previous owner. Complete Care did away with that contract, which also covered four other unionized New Jersey nursing facilities it recently acquired, according to the Service Employees International Union. Complete Care owns 61 facilities in eight states, including Connecticut, Maryland and Wisconsin. It is backed by a private-equity firm called Peace Capital in Lakewood, New Jersey, whose principal owner is Sam Stein. Jordan and her fellow workers are not alone in experiencing reduced circumstances after their company is taken over by a private-equity firm. The new titans of finance, these firms use large pools of debt \u2014 typically raised in what's called the leveraged loan market \u2014 to acquire companies they hope to resell in a few years at a profit. Among companies raising money in this loan market during the past three years, debt levels at private-equity-backed entities were at least 30 percent higher than debt levels at companies not backed by private equity, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. But the heavy debt loads they take on, combined with pressure to flip acquired companies quickly, increases the likelihood that private-equity firms will have to cut costs in the operations that they buy. Often, the first to the chopping block is the company\u2019s workforce. A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research lays this out. Researchers analyzed almost 10,000 debt-fueled buyouts between 1980 and 2013 and found that employment fell by 13 percent when a private-equity firm took over a public company. Employment declined by even more \u2014 16 percent \u2014 when private equity acquired a unit or division of a company. Eileen Appelbaum is an economist and co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, and co-author of \"Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street.\" Her study of private equity has led her to conclude that the industry\u2019s growing clout is not only a concern for workers, but also has the potential to harm the nation\u2019s broader economy. \u201cYou have a lot more ownership of productive resources by investors who don\u2019t know an industry, don\u2019t understand the value of skilled workers and who are just in it to make their profit and get out,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cThat erodes productivity.\u201d Almost 12 million employees, or roughly 7 percent of the U.S. labor force, work for private-equity-backed businesses, according to the American Investment Council, an industry lobbying group. These companies generated about 6.5 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product last year, the group said. The council said private-equity firms create jobs, support businesses and help provide comfortable retirements for pensioners invested in the strategy. A spokeswoman for Complete Care echoed this view. She said the company is committed to the long-term viability of its facilities, adding in a statement: \u201cWe offer a comprehensive health plan and competitive benefits, and our facilities are known as great places to work.\u201d The company is negotiating a new union contract, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, though, care at the Marcella facility is declining, Jordan said, days after she quit. \u201cWe were very short-staffed,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think the residents pick up on that because it takes longer to answer a call.\u201d In a statement, a spokesperson for Complete Care said, \u201cComplete Care at Marcella consistently maintains state mandated ratios. ... We take whatever measures necessary to ensure that we have proper staffing to meet the needs of those in our care, including bringing in agency staff and offering bonuses as needed.\" Private equity is a sophisticated investment strategy that has grown furiously in recent years. At the end of last year, assets under management at the firms worldwide stood at $5 trillion, up from $1.5 trillion over the past decade, according to Preqin, a financial data provider. The number of funds devoted to these activities has more than doubled during that period, and last year, private-equity firms paid some $600 billion to acquire companies, up from $250 billion 10 years earlier. Private-equity firms began their climb to power in the 1980s; then they were known as leveraged buyout shops, because of the debt they use. The $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988 by private-equity giant Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts brought such deals to center stage. In recent years, as prevailing interest rates collapsed, private-equity operations have been able to take on greater amounts of low-cost debt to make their acquisitions. Through Sept. 27, for example, $472 billion of leveraged loans were issued, up from $237 billion issued during the same period in 2019, according to LCD of S&P Global. Outside investors, such as public pension funds and endowments, pour money into these takeover deals in the hopes of generating high returns. But recently, as the stock market has roared, outsize returns in private equity have all but vanished, academic studies show, and they are now in line with overall market performance. Nevertheless, more companies are owned by private-equity firms now than trade on the nation\u2019s stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, private-equity firms\u2019 rising dominance has generated immense wealth for their executives. The value of Sam Stein's holdings in Complete Care could not be determined and the company declined to provide it, but it is almost certainly dwarfed by those of Stephen Schwarzman, head of Blackstone Group. A close adviser to Donald Trump during his presidency, Schwarzman is worth $35 billion, according to Forbes magazine, up from $15 billion in 2020. Private equity also benefited from recent government interventions related to the Covid pandemic, documents show. At least $5 billion in federal bailout money went to companies backed by large and well-capitalized private-equity firms, according to a recent report from Americans for Financial Reform. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board launched an unprecedented $750 billion program to prop up the corporate bond market, where many of these firms raise money for their buyouts. Among the bonds purchased by the Fed, documents show, were those issued by Blackstone and another private-equity giant, Apollo Global Management, founded by Leon Black. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently testified that the agency would increase its scrutiny on fee disclosures and conflicts of interest among private funds, to ensure their practices don't put investors in these strategies at a disadvantage. And Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a late September memo outlining the agency's priorities that \"the growing role of private equity\" invites an examination of how these firms' business models \"may facilitate unfair methods of competition and consumer protection violations.\" Finally, the Democrats\u2019 proposed tax increase on capital gains may crimp private-equity executives\u2019 earnings. A key reason many of these executives have been able to amass such fortunes is that so much of their earnings are taxed as capital gains with a top rate of 20 percent, not at the higher 37 percent rate that can apply to income. This is a benefit they've tapped for decades, often allowing them to pay a lower tax rate on earnings than a secretary or a teacher might. One of the nation\u2019s biggest private-equity employers is Roark Capital of Atlanta. It owns Inspire Brands \u2014 parent company to an array of fast-food chains that includes Arby\u2019s, Dunkin\u2019, Baskin-Robbins and Sonic \u2014 and other brands such as Cinnabon and Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee. NBC News estimates that more than 700,000 people work at Inspire Brands, many at independently owned franchise stores. Roark is named for the libertarian protagonist in \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d by Ayn Rand, whose life \u201cexemplified the qualities of independence and integrity,\u201d the company\u2019s website said. One of libertarianism's basic tenets is limited government, but three dozen companies owned by Roark obtained $183 million in federal assistance under the CARES Act, according to the Americans for Financial Reform report. Asked whether this acceptance of government funding ran counter to a limited government stance, Roark declined to comment through a spokeswoman. Zella Roberts, a recent graduate of Warren Wilson College near Asheville, North Carolina, worked as a carhop at a Sonic Drive-In earlier this year to help pay tuition. Her all-in pay plummeted during the pandemic, Roberts told NBC News, because customers\u2019 cash usage fell and Sonic did not allow tips on credit cards. Roberts said she and some colleagues sent an email to Roark Capital \"explaining the conditions that Sonic workers experience. The big ask was to put pressure on Sonic corporate to make these changes.\" She said she never heard back about that or other messages sent to Neal Aronson, managing partner and founder of Roark Capital. Aronson is the controlling owner of Roark, regulatory filings show, which has $18.6 billion in assets under management. Through a spokeswoman, Aronson declined to comment. In January, after Roberts had collected 7,800 signatures on a petition asking Roark to change its policy, the company allowed tips on credit card orders placed through its app. An improvement, Roberts acknowledged, but such orders are a small percentage of those made via credit cards, she pointed out. The Inspire Brands spokesman said barring tips on credit cards \u201cis a technology limitation that we inherited when we purchased the brand\u201d in 2018. \u201cWe are now working on implementing the credit card tipping capability,\u201d he said. Inspire Brands has also worked to battle the Raise the Wage Act, which has been introduced in Congress every year since 2017 and would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour among workers like Roberts. In March, Inspire sent a memo to franchise owners highlighting its lobbying success in opposing the change. Describing its efforts, Inspire said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you\u2019re on the menu, and you can guarantee your opponents are eating!\u201d Chris Fuller, a spokesman for Inspire Brands, said the company fought the national minimum wage legislation because \u201cwe don\u2019t support a one-size-fits-all approach to the minimum wage. We believe in letting the local markets dictate.\u201d He added: \u201cMore than 90 percent of our team members at corporate-owned restaurants are above the state or local minimum wage.\u201d Some Inspire Brands workers have taken matters into their own hands. This summer, Matthew Honeycutt, 18, was working at an Arby\u2019s in Charlotte, North Carolina, making $9.50 an hour as a shift manager. He supports an 8-month-old son. On July 20, he and a group of workers walked off the job seeking a pay raise, forcing managers to close the Arby\u2019s store two hours early, Honeycutt said. That got management\u2019s attention, he said. \u201cThe strike was on a Tuesday, and it was about Thursday when he started getting the raises out,\u201d Honeycutt said of his boss, who gave him a 50-cents-an-hour raise. \"Every kind of worker you can think of is working so hard, but they're not getting paid what they\u2019re worth.\" Honeycutt\u2019s boss did not respond to a voicemail message seeking comment. In mid-September, Honeycutt quit his job at Arby's for a higher-paying position elsewhere. While Inspire Brands fights against a higher minimum wage, some other restaurant companies owned by publicly traded companies are taking a different approach. They say increasing worker pay is good for business. In February, Robert Verostek, the chief financial officer of restaurant chain Denny\u2019s, told investors that paying a higher wage to its workers in California had resulted in \u201cnot just positive sales, but positive guest traffic.\u201d And in May, McDonald's began increasing pay by 10 percent for almost 37,000 workers in company-owned stores. Shift managers like Honeycutt, who earned $10 at Arby\u2019s, are earning between $15 and $20 an hour depending on the location, McDonald\u2019s said. Sean Dunlop, an equity analyst at Morningstar Research, said Inspire Brands is a well-managed company. But increasing pay and benefits among workers is an industry trend it won't be able to resist. \"As you\u2019re thinking about bigger chains, not only are they making a broader push to a $15 average wage at restaurants, you\u2019ve also seen them offer tuition assistance, paid time off, retention bonuses and referral bonuses as they\u2019ve been trying to attract workers,\" Dunlop said. \"Inspire Brands, if they want to compete, are going to be forced to raise wages. They're going to have to, whether they want to or not.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/silicon-valley-area-food-banks-strain-under-growing-logistical-needs-n1281047", "title": "Silicon Valley area food banks strain under growing logistical needs of poverty", "subtitle": "\u201cInfrastructure requirements have sorely taxed the charitable food system at a time when demand is still extraordinarily high,\u201d one expert said.", "author": "By Cyrus Farivar", "section": null, "body": "RICHMOND, Calif. \u2014 On a recent unseasonably warm October day, dozens of Californians gathered at a food distribution site on a vast, unshaded blacktop space behind an elementary school. In one hour, 193 people waited patiently to fill their carts and shopping bags with produce like bell peppers, apples, onions and squash from the side of a massive truck. \u201cThat\u2019s a record for this year,\u201d said Matthew Durkin, 30, the mobile distribution supervisor, while nodding at the clients and noting that he usually sees only about 160 people. \u201cIt means there\u2019s an increased need.\u201d Durkin, of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, says that while demand for free food has slowed slightly from the start of the pandemic, people are still hungry. \u201cWe have seen another jump in numbers within the last few months. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, adding that many clients have told them how much they fear returning to work. \"They are concerned about Covid-19 surges, as so many of us are, and some of them may need to stay available for unexpected changes in child care and school due to Covid exposures or cases.\u201d More than 18 months into the pandemic, San Francisco Bay Area nonprofit organizations, from food banks to shelters for domestic violence victims, say that they are seeing more demand for their services than they ever saw before the pandemic. Even now, there are still two members of the California National Guard working at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties\u2019 central warehouse in Fairfield. As the pandemic drags on, these support facilities are also struggling with supply chain problems to meet the seemingly endless demand. It presents even more challenges as supplies and workers grow more scarce. Joel Sjostrom, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, has watched the food bank\u2019s demand grow to 300,000 people at the height of the pandemic from 178,000 before the pandemic began. He is now still trying to find support for 240,000 clients each month. Almost immediately after the March 2020 shelter-in-place order was instituted, he said, his organization lost 35 percent of its volunteer workforce because it depends so heavily on older volunteers who were scared to work before they were vaccinated. He had to call in members of the California National Guard, two of which remain. \u201cTo meet those volume increases, we have had to step up facilities and transportation,\u201d Sjostrom added. \u201cI had heard of the National Guard being helpful to others in Southern California.\u201d At one point, there were as many as 25 soldiers working to help this one bank. In California, the National Guard, as of Thursday, still had 140 soldiers deployed to food banks across 16 counties, down from a high of 767 in April 2020, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan M. Shiroma, a California National Guard spokesperson. But the National Guard is gradually trying to cut those numbers back and deploy these workers to other missions. In addition to help from the National Guard, Sjostrom has hired more full-time staff. But even now, even with 16 drivers, he still would like four more \u201cClass A\u201d drivers who can operate big rig trucks. In order to stay competitive with other outfits that employ drivers, he said he has had to raise his rates from $28 per hour to $30 per hour. \u201cIt\u2019s truly market pressure,\u201d Sjostrom said. \u201cAmazon has ads out, as does Hello Fresh, and driver demand is everywhere.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/traffic-stops-are-flashpoint-policing-america-reformers-are-winning-big-n1280594", "title": "Police face a 'crisis of trust' with Black motorists.

Police chiefs aren't happy.", "author": "By Simone Weichselbaum, Emily R. Siegel and Andrew Blankstein", "section": null, "body": "In the months after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, public defenders in Virginia saw an opportunity to overhaul policing in the state. Among their key priorities to address racial disparities: a ban on traffic stops for such infractions as broken taillights, tinted windows and the aroma of marijuana. What happened next stunned police officials across Virginia. In just three months, the ban the public defenders pitched to Democratic legislators sailed to the governor\u2019s desk and was signed into law. With Covid-19 shutting down the state Capitol and forcing the legislative sessions to take place via Zoom, the law enforcement officials who objected to the bill had failed to galvanize the opposition. In March, Virginia became the first state to prohibit the kind of low-level traffic stops that disproportionately affect people of color and are often used as pretexts to search for drugs and weapons. An NBC News analysis of the early data shows that the measure is having an impact on the percentage of Black motorists searched by police during traffic stops. \u201cAs public defenders, we aren\u2019t exactly used to winning, let alone winning big,\u201d said Brad Haywood, the chief public defender for Arlington County and executive director of Justice Forward, a criminal justice reform organization made up of public defenders across the state. \u201cThis will dramatically reduce race-based policing and impact so many lives.\u201d Long a cornerstone of American law enforcement, the traffic stop has emerged as a flashpoint in the debate over police reform. Over the last 20 months, district attorneys in California and Minnesota have ordered prosecutors to drop cases in which officers found guns or drugs during traffic stops for minor infractions. Other states, including Washington and Massachusetts, are considering restrictions similar to Virginia\u2019s. Proponents describe the measures as a long overdue step in banishing a tactic that targets mainly Black drivers and fails to improve public safety. But many law enforcement officials argue that they\u2019re being stripped of a crucial tool that they say helps to reduce vehicle deaths and remove criminals, guns and drugs from the streets, although the police chiefs and sheriffs interviewed for this article struggled to provide data backing up their case. Maggie DeBoard, the chief of the Herndon Police Department in Virginia, said stripping police of the ability to make certain traffic stops will make the roads more susceptible to traffic accidents and create fewer opportunities for officers to encounter people who should be off the streets. \u201cWe are eliminating more and more interactions with criminals by not allowing us to enforce the laws that are on the books,\u201d said DeBoard, who was the president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police as the group fought the bill. \u201cA lot of times you stop a vehicle, you have no idea the race, color, creed, religion of the person you're stopping,\u201d DeBoard said. \u201cYou see a violation, you stop the car. And at night, you definitely don\u2019t know who you\u2019re stopping. So it is not about targeting.\u201d Virginia started collecting detailed traffic stop statistics only in June 2020. The early data suggest that the law is having some effect on how the roads are policed. In the first four months after the law was enacted \u2014 March to June \u2014 the number of overall traffic stops rose by 7 percent compared to the previous four months, which experts said isn\u2019t surprising given that warmer weather tends to attract more drivers to the roads. But the number of motorists subjected to searches after having been pulled over \u2014 the category that the reformers care about most \u2014 dropped sharply, according to an NBC News analysis of police data obtained in a public records request. The number of Black drivers who were searched fell by 40 percent, and the number of white drivers dropped by 30 percent, the data show. Black people still accounted for about 30 percent of all traffic stops \u2014 the same percentage as before the law was changed \u2014 even though they are about 20 percent of the population of Virginia. White people, who make up 65 percent of the population, accounted for slightly under 65 percent of the stops before and after the law was changed, the early data show. Da\u2019Quan Marcell Love, the executive director of the Virginia NAACP, said the decline in the number of searches of Black drivers shows that the reforms are broadly working. But he said advocates are waiting to see how the situation plays out in the long term. \u201cWe have to give it time to work,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe are not launching a celebration any time soon.\u201d Officers stop about 20 million drivers a year, according to federal estimates, for reasons from speeding to blowing through reds light to expired tags. The vast majority of the encounters last only a few minutes and result in tickets or warnings, research shows. Police across the country have long been criticized for using minor infractions such as broken taillights as reasons to stop motorists and investigate them for possible crimes. Criminologists and civil rights lawyers have panned the tactic as a fishing expedition rife with racial bias that yields few results. Frank Baumgartner, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed more than 24 million traffic stops across North Carolina from 2002 to 2020. He found that the encounters led to arrests about 2 percent of the time. Searches also rarely occurred, and when they did, weapons were discovered in one-tenth of 1 percent of incidents. Black people were the subjects of nearly half the stops, Baumgartner found, even though they are only 21 percent of the state\u2019s population. \u201cFor every one bad guy they catch, they alienate, like, 18 young Black men,\u201d Baumgartner said. \u201cThat's where we get to the crisis of trust with the police.\u201d That type of traffic stop led to two of the highest-profile police killings in recent years: those of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Both were Black men who were shot and killed by officers after having been pulled over for broken taillights. Officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder of Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked coast-to-coast calls for reform. Faced with overwhelming public pressure, elected officials are increasingly moving forward with measures to strip away police powers regardless of whether law enforcement leaders support them. Last month, the top prosecutor in Ramsey County, Minnesota, where Castile was killed, announced that he would no longer prosecute  most cases that stem from non-public-safety traffic stops, such as expired tags. He cited the disproportionate impact on people of color, especially Black people, among other reasons. \u201cThe outcome of these stops is that it yields very, very little contraband,\u201d said the prosecutor, County Attorney John Choi. \u201cIf I thought that this would lead to more problems from a public safety perspective, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Larger police departments in Choi\u2019s county supported the move, but the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association described it as \u201cinsulting.\u201d More statewide bans may be on the horizon as politicians continue to openly shrug off opposition from police. Inspired by the change in Virginia\u2019s law, Joe Nguyen, a Democratic state senator in Washington, recently introduced legislation that would prohibit police from pulling motorists over for failing to stop, driving without licenses and other violations. \u201cWe passed a few bills last year that didn\u2019t have law enforcement support, so it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of,\u201d Nguyen said. Some police chiefs across the country, in places like Oakland, California; Minneapolis; and Portland, Oregon, have retooled their traffic enforcement policies to avoid unnecessary confrontations with drivers. The Oakland Police Department issued a directive five years ago discouraging officers from pulling people over for low-level offenses like equipment violations and expired registrations. Since the policies were put in place, the percentage of Black drivers who were stopped fell from 62 percent in 2016 to 51 percent in 2019. The police department enlisted Stanford University to examine its data, which showed that under 3 percent of stops in 2013 and 2014 were linked to more serious crimes. Deputy Police Chief Christopher Bolton urged Oakland police brass reluctant to reform to take a hard look at the statistics. \u201cWhy are we continuing to do those stops when the data is showing that not only is it not effective and efficient, but it could very well be damaging public trust and confidence in what our strategies are?\u201d Bolton asked. But in San Francisco, District Attorney Chesa Boudin\u2019s push to end \u201cpretextual\u201d traffic stops has met fierce resistance from the police. During his second month in office, Boudin told staff members to refrain from prosecuting people who were stopped for minor infractions and found to have \u201ccontraband,\u201d including drugs and guns. Union officials slammed Boudin for creating an environment in which criminals feel comfortable to break the law without fear of punishment. \u201cIf they want to continue to handcuff the police in doing their jobs, the unintended consequences are going to be more crime victims,\u201d said Tony Montoya, the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Union officials blame Boudin\u2019s new traffic policy for the release of a man who was accused of fatally shooting two people weeks after he was pulled over and found with an assault-style rifle without a serial number. The district attorney\u2019s office said its decision not to pursue charges against the suspect, Robert Newt, had nothing to do with the circumstances of the stop. The investigators didn\u2019t provide DNA or fingerprints that could tie Newt to the gun, Boudin\u2019s office said. Rachel Marshall, a spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office, said the policy \u201coffers room for exceptions.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office said it has rejected about one to two cases a month because of Boudin\u2019s rules, for a total of 11 this year. \u201cRacial profiling undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and fosters distrust in communities of color \u2014 all of which decreases public safety,\u201d Marshall said. Police chiefs and sheriffs in Virginia say that the state\u2019s ban went too far and that it is putting lives at risk at a time when murders and fatal accidents are already soaring. The original bill, in fact, would have gone even further by blocking police from stopping vehicles with no front lights. The governor\u2019s office cut the measure after Chesterfield County Police Chief Jeffrey Katz blasted it in a viral Facebook post. The new law permits a driver to have one broken headlight. \u201cLawmakers were making decisions based on the loudest voices in the room, but not necessarily the most informed voices in the room,\u201d Katz said in an interview. \u201cAnd all you have to do is look at the crime rate in the last year and a half.\u201d As in many other states, the number of murders in Virginia has risen sharply since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Virginia State Police. Even though officers can still cite people for speeding and erratic driving, rural county sheriffs said the ban creates an atmosphere in which reckless motorists feel safe to break the law, and they warned that traffic deaths will rise. Fatal traffic accidents in the six months after the law was changed hit a 10-year high, according to an NBC News analysis that compared them to the same period going back to 2011. Jessica Cowardin, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said the rise in traffic deaths mirrors national figures, which are also up. Federal officials blame the increase on speeding, drunk drivers and people who don\u2019t wear seat belts \u2014 violations that police in Virginia can still enforce. For some Virginia police chiefs, the concerns go beyond traffic accidents. In Petersburg, about 20 miles south of Richmond, officers confiscated more than 1,000 guns in the three years leading up to the ban, often in vehicle stops, Police Chief Travis Christian said. But his office was unable to provide data backing up the claim. The analysis of arrest data found that weapons were discovered in about 7 percent of traffic stops in Petersburg from 2018 to 2020. As a chief who is Black, Christian said he is \u201ctorn\u201d over the new law. He acknowledged that Black Virginians feel targeted by police when they are behind the wheel, but he said he still wants the ban reversed. \u201cIt has given us the ability to use it as an investigative tool to get to other crimes that have been committed,\u201d Christian said. \u201cThat tool has been eliminated for us.\u201d David Weisburd, a criminology professor and the executive director of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, said he wasn\u2019t aware of any data that support the claim that low-level traffic stops help to reduce crime. \u201cIt is time, in my view, for the police to bring evidence to their arguments,\u201d Weisburd said. \u201cThat evidence could help in deciding what is reasonable or unreasonable or what is good policing from what is awful policing.\u201d The new law hasn\u2019t put an end to controversial stops in Virginia. Five days after the ban went into effect, state troopers pulled over Juanisha Brooks, 35, a Black woman who is a senior video producer for the Defense Department, as she was driving along a highway in Northern Virginia. A trooper ordered her to get out of the vehicle several times, saying he wanted to show her what was wrong with her car. Brooks refused, saying she didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t tell her while she remained in the vehicle. Dashcam video appears to show the trooper dragging Brooks out of the seat and pushing her up against her car. Officers charged her with reckless driving, eluding, obstruction of justice and failing to have her headlights on. Prosecutors dropped the case, noting that the stop was illegal because of the reforms. Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, insisted that the arrest was fair because Brooks refused to comply with the trooper\u2019s commands. State Police conducted an internal investigation; Geller said she couldn\u2019t share whether the trooper was disciplined because of privacy rules. \u201cI was afraid for my life,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be another hashtag.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ems-services-warn-crippling-labor-shortage-undermining-911-system-rcna2677", "title": "EMS services warn of 'crippling labor shortage' undermining 911 system", "subtitle": "\u201cWe\u2019re not bleeding any longer \u2014 we\u2019re hemorrhaging,\u201d one ambulance service operator said of a decadelong worker shortage exacerbated by the pandemic.", "author": "By Phil McCausland", "section": null, "body": "The pandemic-induced shortage of emergency medical technicians and paramedics nationwide is so dire that ambulance service providers warn of sharp cuts to services and longer waits for 911 calls \u2014 even when it\u2019s a matter of life or death. Companies have had to close, consolidate or come up with new strategies to answer calls, said American Ambulance Association President Shawn Baird, who added that there is simply not enough EMS personnel to cover calls in many parts of the country, especially during the pandemic. The loss of staff to pandemic-related burnout and low wages has created a vicious cycle, requiring greater dependence on those workers who have stayed on. The situation has deteriorated to such a degree in recent months that ambulance services and industry leaders are pleading with Congress and state legislatures to help. \"The magnitude has really blown up over the last few months,\" Baird said. \"When you take a system that was already fragile and stretched it, because you didn't have enough people entering the field, then you throw a public health emergency and all of the additional burdens that it put on our workforce as well as the labor shortages across the entire economy, and it really has put us in a crisis mode.\" It's a crisis that has made it difficult to hire and even harder to retain EMTs and paramedics, according to a AAA survey of 258 EMS organizations across the country. In 2020, nearly a third of the workforce left their ambulance company after less than a year, the survey said. Eleven percent left within the first three months. \"It's almost unmanageable,\" said Ken Cummings, who leads Tri-Hospital EMS in Port Huron, Michigan. \"I don't think any EMS provider wants to go out in public and say that your service might be interrupted, but the reality is that because of the extremely low workforce situation right now, we are going to start to see delays. We're already seeing that throughout the country right now.\" Cummings said he currently has 10 openings, about 10 percent of his workforce. He's currently paying double overtime to fill the gap left by those empty positions, but that has increased the average work week of his paramedics by at least eight hours. The amount of money he's paying in overtime is also becoming untenable, and his workers are losing interest in the extra cash. \"We're spending money today that we're hoping we get tomorrow, to be real honest with you,\" he said. \"It's not a long-term solution.\" There are an estimated 1,000 open EMS positions in Michigan alone, Cummings said. The good news for Cummings is that he has a handful of students who will graduate next year from the paramedic program, but the churn is constant. The Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, also agreed to allocate $12.9 million of the state's budget to increase reimbursement rates. But that has not slowed the revolving-door nature of the job. Among full-time EMTs, 47 percent reported in 2020 that the reason for leaving was for a career or occupation change, according to the survey. That number is 45 percent among paramedics. \"In my experience running an EMS service, I've seen more than a few employees get into the industry and leave within six months,\" said Judd Smith, the program director of Texas EMS School in Abilene. \"I'll see people work for three weeks and then move on to the next thing.\" The decline in Texas has been particularly substantial. By mid-August, only 27 percent of licensed EMS professionals had submitted a patient care record, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, meaning that over 70 percent of licensed Texas EMTs did not work on an ambulance in the first eight months of the year. That represents a significant drop from the 43 percent of EMTs who submitted reports in 2020 and the 45 percent who did in 2019. The circumstances have pushed the American Ambulance Association and National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians to send a letter to Congress last week pushing for a hearing to address the shortfall and asking for more funding to increase wages. The letter warned that \"our nation\u2019s EMS system is facing a crippling workforce shortage, a long-term problem that has been building for more than a decade. It threatens to undermine our emergency 9-1-1 infrastructure and deserves urgent attention by the Congress.\" The pandemic has made a bad labor problem worse. The spread of the virus, the frequency of calls, worry of potential infection and the necessary safeguards that emergency personnel must take to protect themselves have created additional stress that has caused many to leave the field, providers said. Their departure has then increased the need for those who remain to work overtime, pushing even more to leave the field. The nationwide health emergency also caused many EMT and paramedic courses to shut down, meaning there is a dearth of students coming into the industry. \"We're not bleeding any longer \u2014 we're hemorrhaging,\" said Gary Wadaga, who operates Bay Ambulance in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Ambulance companies have faced years of workforce challenges that has damaged their ability to respond to calls quickly, but the situation is getting worse. Last year, because an ambulance service closed south of his company's service area, Wadaga had to take on an additional 100 square miles of territory. Now he covers 1,500 square miles and receives about 1,000 calls a year with six paramedic positions. The trouble is, he's been unable to fill two spots and has another two workers on leave, leaving him and one other person to respond to every emergency call that comes in. \"I've not seen it this bad in 41 years, and you can't just set that aside,\" said Wadaga, adding that the increasing demands of the job have caused him great anxiety. \"You want to be there for your community, but the fact that one day we're not going to have enough people absolutely bothers me.\" Ambulance companies once had the luxury of considering applicants, but that appears to be a concept of the past. Now companies are actively recruiting and even going after one another's employees because the pool of eligible workers is so small. \"Overall, it's robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Baird, \"because every community needs these folks.\" Wadaga and other ambulance service operators said the pandemic has increased the viciousness of a labor shortage and put the nation's emergency medical system at risk of a \"death spiral\" that could be difficult to pull out of. The salary requests of a shrinking workforce are getting higher as wages remain stagnant. The 2020 median pay for EMTs and paramedics was $36,650 per year or $17.62 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about a 7.5 percent increase since 2011. Advocates said the wages don't match the requirements of the job anymore. \"When you're an EMS provider putting your life on the line and entering into a closed environments with infectious patients and you can make more money to work in an Amazon warehouse, it becomes really difficult to retain people,\" said Robert Luckritz, who serves as chair of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians' EMS Workforce Committee. But it's not just retail and warehouse work that's calling. Luckritz said that hospitals facing their own nursing and health care worker shortages are at times actively recruiting EMT and paramedics, promising higher wages, better hours and increased benefits. That's an issue Luckritz and his colleagues are attempting to work on, but it's a challenge. They need more money to hire more people, but ambulance company rates are set by insurance providers and the government when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, which both contribute to the vast majority of calls, Luckritz said. \"Unlike much of the other industries across the country ... we're not able to raise our prices \u2014 our prices are set by the government,\" he said. \"So with reimbursement not keeping up with our costs, it makes it very difficult for us to compete for the workforce.\" The fear is that if the country doesn't face these problems now, they will be unfixable down the line. Baird, the AAA president, said that if things spiral too far down, \"we can\u2019t get people to even enter the field because it looks too daunting.\" \"We have to turn this around,\" he said. One silver lining is that online EMS programs, such as Smith's Texas EMS School, are seeing increased interest \u2014 even as nationwide there is a decline in enrollment in traditional programs. The number of applications for their EMT program, which can be completed in 10 to 18 weeks via a mix of online coursework and hands-on clinical and field experience, jumped from 495 applicants in 2019 to 1,469 in 2021. The jobs certainly are there waiting for them at graduation. \"I don't know of any one of our students that doesn't get hired within the first week of getting licensed,\" Smith said. \"We've even had a big number of them get hired before they even received their certification, so they start working as soon as they're done.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-stake-2022-hopes-child-cash-benefits-there-s-just-n1281142", "title": "Democrats stake 2022 hopes on child cash benefits.

But in doing so, they planted an election-year time bomb for their own party, and their only realistic hope of defusing it in time is to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s social spending bill. At the center of the American Rescue Plan is a monthly payment structured as a tax credit for the vast majority of families \u2014 of $300 per child under 6 years old or $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. The benefit has been well received in polls, and studies say it quickly lifted millions of U.S. kids out of poverty. But there\u2019s a catch: It is only authorized for 2021. The payments end in December unless extended. With Republicans opposed, the only realistic vehicle to extend them is Biden\u2019s multitrillion-dollar bill, which Democratic leaders are working feverishly to craft. Allowing the payments to expire would risk erasing the economic gains and leaving struggling parents who have come to rely on it in the lurch. Democratic operatives warn it could turn a significant political asset into a liability just months before an election in which Republicans are historically favored to make gains. \u201cLetting the extremely popular child care tax credit expire would be exactly the type of mistake we can\u2019t afford,\u201d Tyler Law, a Democratic consultant who worked for the party\u2019s House election arm during the 2018 blue wave, said. \u201cDemocrats need to deliver win after win after win to show voters we can govern and deserve to stay in power,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet for success, but there\u2019s certainly a recipe for disaster: failing to pass the Biden agenda.\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the child tax credit has had a major impact in alleviating poverty and held it up as an example that says Democrats, when in charge, can help Americans. \u201cThe idea of letting it expire, I think, would be horrific,\u201d he said. While Democrats battle over what provisions make it into the bill, they appear to agree unanimously that the money for kids should be extended \u2014 from centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., to progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. But the details are unclear. The House version of the bill extends the payments through 2025. That may be adjusted as lawmakers sort out how to cut down the plan's price tag to get the centrists on board. And the income threshold for who is eligible may be adjusted as Manchin has demanded additional means-testing for the various programs in the bill. \u201cThere's some differences of opinion about how to do it, and how long to fund it, etcetera. And it has to fit within the overall top line of the bill,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. \u201cBut every Dem really wants it to happen.\u201d Republicans are adamantly opposed to the program and say it should expire. \u201cThe federal government shouldn't be in the business of just handing out money because you have kids,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said. \u201cThat's ridiculous.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Democrats of \u201ctrying to build a permanent welfare class in the country,\u201d saying the child tax credit includes \u201cdistributing more borrowed money to people who don't have a need for it.\u201d Some Democrats are spoiling for that fight. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the party\u2019s House campaign arm, projected confidence that Democrats will pass the bill, extend the child cash payments and then run on them. \u201cWe're going to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact that the Republicans have opposed it at every step of the way will come back to haunt them. I believe that it's exactly that type of thing that is the anvil on which we will hammer them in 2022.\u201d Sean McElwee, a progressive pollster who has been cited by the White House, said his firm has found that voters who received the child cash payment approve of Biden's job performance by a wide margin of 66 percent to 32 percent, whereas voters who haven't gotten it split evenly with 49 percent approving and disapproving. The firm, Data for Progress, found that those who voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020 and who receive the child tax credit register 79 percent disapproval of Biden, whereas 92 percent of those who do not receive it disapprove of the president. \u201cEnding the child tax credit would risk washing away these key persuasion gains that will be necessary to win in 2022 and 2024,\u201d McElwee said. Overall, the child cash payments are supported by 59 percent of U.S. adults, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. That includes 75 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of Republicans. Some of the states with the highest average per-month cash payments are conservative states. Progressives cite the program as an example of how government can make Americans' lives better. \u201cWe already have powerful data showing us that this tax credit is reducing hunger in America. It's providing school shoes and backpacks for kids to be able to go back to school,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u201cWe need to protect this \u2014 not just because it expires in an election year. We need to protect it because this helps American families.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/squid-game-entertaining-world-there-s-different-feeling-south-korea-n1281119", "title": "'Squid Game' is entertaining the world.

Because everyone else is. The nine-episode horror series on Netflix has hit No. 1 in 90 of the streaming service\u2019s markets around the world, including South Korea, where it was made. \u201cI got to the point where I could not hold a conversation without watching the show,\u201d said Jung Dunn, a security analyst in Seoul, the South Korean capital. But the show also strikes a nerve because it unflinchingly addresses a problem that is particularly entrenched in South Korea: debt and the never-ending struggle to pay it off. The cast of \u201cSquid Game\u201d features some of South Korea\u2019s biggest stars, including Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist, Seong Gi-hun, a hopelessly indebted father who receives a business card from a stranger offering him a way out. Along with 455 other contestants \u2014 from all walks of life but all deeply in debt too \u2014 he agrees to compete for a cash prize of 45.6 billion won (about $38 million) by playing a series of traditional Korean children\u2019s games, only to discover that elimination from each round means death. \u201cThere\u2019s this dissonance between Korean pride that this Korean show is dominating Netflix all around the world, and the discomfort with what the show appears to expose about Korea,\u201d said CedarBough Saeji, an assistant professor of Korean and East Asian studies at Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea. \u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing.\u201d That South Korea also produced \u201cParasite,\u201d the 2020 Oscar winner for best picture that also focused on themes of inequality, has probably accentuated this discomfort, Saeji said. Still, \u201cSquid Game\u201d is wildly popular in its home country. The show was released on Sept. 17 just before Chuseok, a Korean holiday similar to Thanksgiving when families gather, the perfect time for binge-watching. The surge in network traffic led one internet service provider to sue Netflix to cover its costs. The fervor has also spilled over into real life. A street vendor in Seoul who provided the makers of \u201cSquid Game\u201d with dalgona, a brittle sugar candy at the center of one of the games, told Reuters that he had seen a boom in business. Thousands of curious South Koreans also tried the eight-digit phone number that appears on the business card, which the show\u2019s makers didn\u2019t realize would reach an actual person. The owner of the number, and even people with similar numbers, have been inundated with calls and messages at all hours. On Wednesday, Netflix said it was working with the show\u2019s local production company to address the issue, including editing scenes to remove the number. Park Sae-ha, a senior studying economics at Yonsei University in Seoul, said \u201cSquid Game\u201d was \u201cspell-binding because it was so explicit and blunt.\u201d \u201cAlthough I am young, I could easily relate to the hard reality of a very competitive society,\u201d she said. That intense competitiveness may be one reason South Korea has been so successful, with a period of rapid industrialization starting in the 1960s that turned it into the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. But as in many other countries, a university degree and a white-collar job don\u2019t guarantee the financial security they used to, Saeji said. With an average income of about $42,000 a year, many Koreans now find they have to borrow to keep up. Fueled by low interest rates, household debt in South Korea has grown significantly in recent years, and is now equal to the country\u2019s annual GDP. (In the U.S., by contrast, household debt is about 80 percent of GDP.) People may rack up debt because of credit card spending, unemployment or gambling losses, but a large chunk of it is tied to real estate. Housing prices have been rising fast, especially under President Moon Jae-in, and the average price of an apartment in Seoul is nearing $1 million. Lending curbs and efforts to cool the housing market have done little to rein in household borrowing. In addition to housing, some Koreans, especially young people, borrow money to invest in cryptocurrency. Many Koreans start out by borrowing from legitimate financial institutions like banks, said Koo Se-Woong, a commentator on Korean culture based in Germany. When that avenue is exhausted, they may move on to second-tier lenders that charge higher interest. In the worst-case scenarios, he said, borrowers turn to loan shark operations that can charge triple-digit interest rates, \u201cand then you are pushed into situations from which you really cannot get out.\u201d According to some estimates, there are 400,000 Koreans in debt to loan sharks. \u201cWhen you look at the characters in the show who are participating in this game, they represent that demographic of the Koreans who are in the worst possible situation because of their personal debt,\u201d Koo said. In a recent widely shared Facebook post, Koo said he was shocked when a friend told him he was living paycheck to paycheck, despite having a good job. The friend \u201cdoesn't strike anyone as extravagant,\u201d Koo said, but struggles to afford the trappings of middle-class life: an apartment, a car and occasional travel with his wife and children. \"It's all paid for by loans, I am telling you,\" Koo said his friend told him. \"We just have no money.\" Jung, the security analyst, said the plot of \u201cSquid Game\u201d was easy to accept because \u201cit dealt with such familiar stories of debt-ridden people you come across in real life.\u201d \u201cThe story stems from a deeply rooted perception of how society looks at failure, especially individual financial failure,\u201d he said. Bankruptcy in South Korea is generally seen not as a chance to start over but as a devastating fate. That is underlined in \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Saeji said, when contestants are given the option to leave but choose to keep playing even at the risk of their lives. \u201cIn the regular world it\u2019s not just the death of their body, it\u2019s the death of their pride. It\u2019s the shame of having to be such an unsuccessful person in front of your family,\u201d she said. Viewers in South Korea say the show is all the more disturbing because it injects death and violence into playground games like Red Light, Green Light and tug of war. The show plays on childhood nostalgia \u201cand along with it the innocent times when you had no problems,\u201d said Kim Hern-sik, a pop culture critic in Seoul. \u201cYet the story tells you that escaping from reality is not the answer.\u201d \u201cSquid Game\u201d is \u201cfundamentally a Korean story, featuring games people would remember playing as kids,\u201d Don Kang, vice president of Korean content at Netflix, told NBC News in an email. \u201cSo we knew it would resonate with our members here.\u201d Its popularity in the West came as more of a surprise. But Korean cultural exports have been sweeping Asia for years, and Netflix was already betting on their growing appeal. The company is spending $500 million this year on Korean content, almost as much as it spent in the last five years. Saeji said that after decades of Western cultural influence, the success of \u201cSquid Game\u201d shows that South Korea can make a TV show with a Hollywood feel \u201cand they can do it better.\u201d While \u201cSquid Game\u201d is not the first story about a fight to the death, director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who has a film degree from the University of Southern California, made it influential in his own way, said Oh Dong-jin, a prominent film critic in South Korea. \u201cEvery movie borrows this and that from other movies. What matters, therefore, is how creatively you can borrow from different references,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, even from this standpoint, the traditional children\u2019s games the show uses make 'Squid Game' quite original.\u201d Margie Kim, a housewife in Seoul who is watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d with her family, said that while she enjoyed its intensity and pop-art-influenced visuals, the underlying messages were also important. \u201cI do feel the pain of what our society is going through,\u201d she said. The show deals with so many pressing issues, she said\u2014income inequality, youth unemployment, a rapidly aging society\u2014that it\u2019s something her entire family can relate to and talk about. \u201cSo many middle-class, ordinary people live with so much debt,\u201d she said. \u201cI could totally empathize with people who joined the game.\u201d Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Stella Kim reported from Los Angeles.", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/working-companies-owned-well-heeled-private-equity-firms-can-mean-n1281146", "title": "Working for companies owned by well-heeled private-equity firms can mean lower wages for employees", "subtitle": "Workers at some fast-food chains owned by public firms are getting better wages now.

They were like family, she said, and she believes they\u2019ve appreciated her attentiveness, especially during Covid-19. Not so, the nursing home\u2019s new owner, Jordan said. After Complete Care Management, the largest for-profit nursing home operator in New Jersey, took over the 150-bed Marcella Center in April, it slashed worker benefits, she and other employees as well as a representative from their union told NBC News. Amid the pandemic, Jordan\u2019s paid holidays were reduced, and her monthly health insurance costs more than tripled, she said. The company stopped contributing to the employee pension, replacing it with a 401(k) plan that had no employer match or contribution. Complete Care took away vision insurance and stopped a reimbursement program covering employee education costs, so Jordan, 45, won\u2019t be able to recoup money she spent working toward a degree to become a licensed practical nurse. \u201cI put all my effort into this company, and someone else took over and they don\u2019t want to give us what we deserve,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s business. It\u2019s not about the staff and the residents. It\u2019s only about making profits.\u201d In late September, Jordan quit her position at the facility. The reduced benefits and deteriorating work conditions got to be too much, she said. When Complete Care came in, Jordan and other Marcella workers were operating under a union contract struck with the facility\u2019s previous owner. Complete Care did away with that contract, which also covered four other unionized New Jersey nursing facilities it recently acquired, according to the Service Employees International Union. Complete Care owns 61 facilities in eight states, including Connecticut, Maryland and Wisconsin. It is backed by a private-equity firm called Peace Capital in Lakewood, New Jersey, whose principal owner is Sam Stein. Jordan and her fellow workers are not alone in experiencing reduced circumstances after their company is taken over by a private-equity firm. The new titans of finance, these firms use large pools of debt \u2014 typically raised in what's called the leveraged loan market \u2014 to acquire companies they hope to resell in a few years at a profit. Among companies raising money in this loan market during the past three years, debt levels at private-equity-backed entities were at least 30 percent higher than debt levels at companies not backed by private equity, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. But the heavy debt loads they take on, combined with pressure to flip acquired companies quickly, increases the likelihood that private-equity firms will have to cut costs in the operations that they buy. Often, the first to the chopping block is the company\u2019s workforce. A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research lays this out. Researchers analyzed almost 10,000 debt-fueled buyouts between 1980 and 2013 and found that employment fell by 13 percent when a private-equity firm took over a public company. Employment declined by even more \u2014 16 percent \u2014 when private equity acquired a unit or division of a company. Eileen Appelbaum is an economist and co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, and co-author of \"Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street.\" Her study of private equity has led her to conclude that the industry\u2019s growing clout is not only a concern for workers, but also has the potential to harm the nation\u2019s broader economy. \u201cYou have a lot more ownership of productive resources by investors who don\u2019t know an industry, don\u2019t understand the value of skilled workers and who are just in it to make their profit and get out,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cThat erodes productivity.\u201d Almost 12 million employees, or roughly 7 percent of the U.S. labor force, work for private-equity-backed businesses, according to the American Investment Council, an industry lobbying group. These companies generated about 6.5 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product last year, the group said. The council said private-equity firms create jobs, support businesses and help provide comfortable retirements for pensioners invested in the strategy. A spokeswoman for Complete Care echoed this view. She said the company is committed to the long-term viability of its facilities, adding in a statement: \u201cWe offer a comprehensive health plan and competitive benefits, and our facilities are known as great places to work.\u201d The company is negotiating a new union contract, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, though, care at the Marcella facility is declining, Jordan said, days after she quit. \u201cWe were very short-staffed,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think the residents pick up on that because it takes longer to answer a call.\u201d In a statement, a spokesperson for Complete Care said, \u201cComplete Care at Marcella consistently maintains state mandated ratios. ... We take whatever measures necessary to ensure that we have proper staffing to meet the needs of those in our care, including bringing in agency staff and offering bonuses as needed.\" Private equity is a sophisticated investment strategy that has grown furiously in recent years. At the end of last year, assets under management at the firms worldwide stood at $5 trillion, up from $1.5 trillion over the past decade, according to Preqin, a financial data provider. The number of funds devoted to these activities has more than doubled during that period, and last year, private-equity firms paid some $600 billion to acquire companies, up from $250 billion 10 years earlier. Private-equity firms began their climb to power in the 1980s; then they were known as leveraged buyout shops, because of the debt they use. The $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988 by private-equity giant Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts brought such deals to center stage. In recent years, as prevailing interest rates collapsed, private-equity operations have been able to take on greater amounts of low-cost debt to make their acquisitions. Through Sept. 27, for example, $472 billion of leveraged loans were issued, up from $237 billion issued during the same period in 2019, according to LCD of S&P Global. Outside investors, such as public pension funds and endowments, pour money into these takeover deals in the hopes of generating high returns. But recently, as the stock market has roared, outsize returns in private equity have all but vanished, academic studies show, and they are now in line with overall market performance. Nevertheless, more companies are owned by private-equity firms now than trade on the nation\u2019s stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, private-equity firms\u2019 rising dominance has generated immense wealth for their executives. The value of Sam Stein's holdings in Complete Care could not be determined and the company declined to provide it, but it is almost certainly dwarfed by those of Stephen Schwarzman, head of Blackstone Group. A close adviser to Donald Trump during his presidency, Schwarzman is worth $35 billion, according to Forbes magazine, up from $15 billion in 2020. Private equity also benefited from recent government interventions related to the Covid pandemic, documents show. At least $5 billion in federal bailout money went to companies backed by large and well-capitalized private-equity firms, according to a recent report from Americans for Financial Reform. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board launched an unprecedented $750 billion program to prop up the corporate bond market, where many of these firms raise money for their buyouts. Among the bonds purchased by the Fed, documents show, were those issued by Blackstone and another private-equity giant, Apollo Global Management, founded by Leon Black. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently testified that the agency would increase its scrutiny on fee disclosures and conflicts of interest among private funds, to ensure their practices don't put investors in these strategies at a disadvantage. And Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a late September memo outlining the agency's priorities that \"the growing role of private equity\" invites an examination of how these firms' business models \"may facilitate unfair methods of competition and consumer protection violations.\" Finally, the Democrats\u2019 proposed tax increase on capital gains may crimp private-equity executives\u2019 earnings. A key reason many of these executives have been able to amass such fortunes is that so much of their earnings are taxed as capital gains with a top rate of 20 percent, not at the higher 37 percent rate that can apply to income. This is a benefit they've tapped for decades, often allowing them to pay a lower tax rate on earnings than a secretary or a teacher might. One of the nation\u2019s biggest private-equity employers is Roark Capital of Atlanta. It owns Inspire Brands \u2014 parent company to an array of fast-food chains that includes Arby\u2019s, Dunkin\u2019, Baskin-Robbins and Sonic \u2014 and other brands such as Cinnabon and Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee. NBC News estimates that more than 700,000 people work at Inspire Brands, many at independently owned franchise stores. Roark is named for the libertarian protagonist in \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d by Ayn Rand, whose life \u201cexemplified the qualities of independence and integrity,\u201d the company\u2019s website said. One of libertarianism's basic tenets is limited government, but three dozen companies owned by Roark obtained $183 million in federal assistance under the CARES Act, according to the Americans for Financial Reform report. Asked whether this acceptance of government funding ran counter to a limited government stance, Roark declined to comment through a spokeswoman. Zella Roberts, a recent graduate of Warren Wilson College near Asheville, North Carolina, worked as a carhop at a Sonic Drive-In earlier this year to help pay tuition. Her all-in pay plummeted during the pandemic, Roberts told NBC News, because customers\u2019 cash usage fell and Sonic did not allow tips on credit cards. Roberts said she and some colleagues sent an email to Roark Capital \"explaining the conditions that Sonic workers experience. The big ask was to put pressure on Sonic corporate to make these changes.\" She said she never heard back about that or other messages sent to Neal Aronson, managing partner and founder of Roark Capital. Aronson is the controlling owner of Roark, regulatory filings show, which has $18.6 billion in assets under management. Through a spokeswoman, Aronson declined to comment. In January, after Roberts had collected 7,800 signatures on a petition asking Roark to change its policy, the company allowed tips on credit card orders placed through its app. An improvement, Roberts acknowledged, but such orders are a small percentage of those made via credit cards, she pointed out. The Inspire Brands spokesman said barring tips on credit cards \u201cis a technology limitation that we inherited when we purchased the brand\u201d in 2018. \u201cWe are now working on implementing the credit card tipping capability,\u201d he said. Inspire Brands has also worked to battle the Raise the Wage Act, which has been introduced in Congress every year since 2017 and would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour among workers like Roberts. In March, Inspire sent a memo to franchise owners highlighting its lobbying success in opposing the change. Describing its efforts, Inspire said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you\u2019re on the menu, and you can guarantee your opponents are eating!\u201d Chris Fuller, a spokesman for Inspire Brands, said the company fought the national minimum wage legislation because \u201cwe don\u2019t support a one-size-fits-all approach to the minimum wage. We believe in letting the local markets dictate.\u201d He added: \u201cMore than 90 percent of our team members at corporate-owned restaurants are above the state or local minimum wage.\u201d Some Inspire Brands workers have taken matters into their own hands. This summer, Matthew Honeycutt, 18, was working at an Arby\u2019s in Charlotte, North Carolina, making $9.50 an hour as a shift manager. He supports an 8-month-old son. On July 20, he and a group of workers walked off the job seeking a pay raise, forcing managers to close the Arby\u2019s store two hours early, Honeycutt said. That got management\u2019s attention, he said. \u201cThe strike was on a Tuesday, and it was about Thursday when he started getting the raises out,\u201d Honeycutt said of his boss, who gave him a 50-cents-an-hour raise. \"Every kind of worker you can think of is working so hard, but they're not getting paid what they\u2019re worth.\" Honeycutt\u2019s boss did not respond to a voicemail message seeking comment. In mid-September, Honeycutt quit his job at Arby's for a higher-paying position elsewhere. While Inspire Brands fights against a higher minimum wage, some other restaurant companies owned by publicly traded companies are taking a different approach. They say increasing worker pay is good for business. In February, Robert Verostek, the chief financial officer of restaurant chain Denny\u2019s, told investors that paying a higher wage to its workers in California had resulted in \u201cnot just positive sales, but positive guest traffic.\u201d And in May, McDonald's began increasing pay by 10 percent for almost 37,000 workers in company-owned stores. Shift managers like Honeycutt, who earned $10 at Arby\u2019s, are earning between $15 and $20 an hour depending on the location, McDonald\u2019s said. Sean Dunlop, an equity analyst at Morningstar Research, said Inspire Brands is a well-managed company. But increasing pay and benefits among workers is an industry trend it won't be able to resist. \"As you\u2019re thinking about bigger chains, not only are they making a broader push to a $15 average wage at restaurants, you\u2019ve also seen them offer tuition assistance, paid time off, retention bonuses and referral bonuses as they\u2019ve been trying to attract workers,\" Dunlop said. \"Inspire Brands, if they want to compete, are going to be forced to raise wages. They're going to have to, whether they want to or not.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/silicon-valley-area-food-banks-strain-under-growing-logistical-needs-n1281047", "title": "Silicon Valley area food banks strain under growing logistical needs of poverty", "subtitle": "\u201cInfrastructure requirements have sorely taxed the charitable food system at a time when demand is still extraordinarily high,\u201d one expert said.", "author": "By Cyrus Farivar", "section": null, "body": "RICHMOND, Calif. \u2014 On a recent unseasonably warm October day, dozens of Californians gathered at a food distribution site on a vast, unshaded blacktop space behind an elementary school. In one hour, 193 people waited patiently to fill their carts and shopping bags with produce like bell peppers, apples, onions and squash from the side of a massive truck. \u201cThat\u2019s a record for this year,\u201d said Matthew Durkin, 30, the mobile distribution supervisor, while nodding at the clients and noting that he usually sees only about 160 people. \u201cIt means there\u2019s an increased need.\u201d Durkin, of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, says that while demand for free food has slowed slightly from the start of the pandemic, people are still hungry. \u201cWe have seen another jump in numbers within the last few months. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, adding that many clients have told them how much they fear returning to work. \"They are concerned about Covid-19 surges, as so many of us are, and some of them may need to stay available for unexpected changes in child care and school due to Covid exposures or cases.\u201d More than 18 months into the pandemic, San Francisco Bay Area nonprofit organizations, from food banks to shelters for domestic violence victims, say that they are seeing more demand for their services than they ever saw before the pandemic. Even now, there are still two members of the California National Guard working at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties\u2019 central warehouse in Fairfield. As the pandemic drags on, these support facilities are also struggling with supply chain problems to meet the seemingly endless demand. It presents even more challenges as supplies and workers grow more scarce. Joel Sjostrom, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, has watched the food bank\u2019s demand grow to 300,000 people at the height of the pandemic from 178,000 before the pandemic began. He is now still trying to find support for 240,000 clients each month. Almost immediately after the March 2020 shelter-in-place order was instituted, he said, his organization lost 35 percent of its volunteer workforce because it depends so heavily on older volunteers who were scared to work before they were vaccinated. He had to call in members of the California National Guard, two of which remain. \u201cTo meet those volume increases, we have had to step up facilities and transportation,\u201d Sjostrom added. \u201cI had heard of the National Guard being helpful to others in Southern California.\u201d At one point, there were as many as 25 soldiers working to help this one bank. In California, the National Guard, as of Thursday, still had 140 soldiers deployed to food banks across 16 counties, down from a high of 767 in April 2020, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan M. Shiroma, a California National Guard spokesperson. But the National Guard is gradually trying to cut those numbers back and deploy these workers to other missions. In addition to help from the National Guard, Sjostrom has hired more full-time staff. But even now, even with 16 drivers, he still would like four more \u201cClass A\u201d drivers who can operate big rig trucks. In order to stay competitive with other outfits that employ drivers, he said he has had to raise his rates from $28 per hour to $30 per hour. \u201cIt\u2019s truly market pressure,\u201d Sjostrom said. \u201cAmazon has ads out, as does Hello Fresh, and driver demand is everywhere.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/traffic-stops-are-flashpoint-policing-america-reformers-are-winning-big-n1280594", "title": "Police face a 'crisis of trust' with Black motorists.

Police chiefs aren't happy.", "author": "By Simone Weichselbaum, Emily R. Siegel and Andrew Blankstein", "section": null, "body": "In the months after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, public defenders in Virginia saw an opportunity to overhaul policing in the state. Among their key priorities to address racial disparities: a ban on traffic stops for such infractions as broken taillights, tinted windows and the aroma of marijuana. What happened next stunned police officials across Virginia. In just three months, the ban the public defenders pitched to Democratic legislators sailed to the governor\u2019s desk and was signed into law. With Covid-19 shutting down the state Capitol and forcing the legislative sessions to take place via Zoom, the law enforcement officials who objected to the bill had failed to galvanize the opposition. In March, Virginia became the first state to prohibit the kind of low-level traffic stops that disproportionately affect people of color and are often used as pretexts to search for drugs and weapons. An NBC News analysis of the early data shows that the measure is having an impact on the percentage of Black motorists searched by police during traffic stops. \u201cAs public defenders, we aren\u2019t exactly used to winning, let alone winning big,\u201d said Brad Haywood, the chief public defender for Arlington County and executive director of Justice Forward, a criminal justice reform organization made up of public defenders across the state. \u201cThis will dramatically reduce race-based policing and impact so many lives.\u201d Long a cornerstone of American law enforcement, the traffic stop has emerged as a flashpoint in the debate over police reform. Over the last 20 months, district attorneys in California and Minnesota have ordered prosecutors to drop cases in which officers found guns or drugs during traffic stops for minor infractions. Other states, including Washington and Massachusetts, are considering restrictions similar to Virginia\u2019s. Proponents describe the measures as a long overdue step in banishing a tactic that targets mainly Black drivers and fails to improve public safety. But many law enforcement officials argue that they\u2019re being stripped of a crucial tool that they say helps to reduce vehicle deaths and remove criminals, guns and drugs from the streets, although the police chiefs and sheriffs interviewed for this article struggled to provide data backing up their case. Maggie DeBoard, the chief of the Herndon Police Department in Virginia, said stripping police of the ability to make certain traffic stops will make the roads more susceptible to traffic accidents and create fewer opportunities for officers to encounter people who should be off the streets. \u201cWe are eliminating more and more interactions with criminals by not allowing us to enforce the laws that are on the books,\u201d said DeBoard, who was the president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police as the group fought the bill. \u201cA lot of times you stop a vehicle, you have no idea the race, color, creed, religion of the person you're stopping,\u201d DeBoard said. \u201cYou see a violation, you stop the car. And at night, you definitely don\u2019t know who you\u2019re stopping. So it is not about targeting.\u201d Virginia started collecting detailed traffic stop statistics only in June 2020. The early data suggest that the law is having some effect on how the roads are policed. In the first four months after the law was enacted \u2014 March to June \u2014 the number of overall traffic stops rose by 7 percent compared to the previous four months, which experts said isn\u2019t surprising given that warmer weather tends to attract more drivers to the roads. But the number of motorists subjected to searches after having been pulled over \u2014 the category that the reformers care about most \u2014 dropped sharply, according to an NBC News analysis of police data obtained in a public records request. The number of Black drivers who were searched fell by 40 percent, and the number of white drivers dropped by 30 percent, the data show. Black people still accounted for about 30 percent of all traffic stops \u2014 the same percentage as before the law was changed \u2014 even though they are about 20 percent of the population of Virginia. White people, who make up 65 percent of the population, accounted for slightly under 65 percent of the stops before and after the law was changed, the early data show. Da\u2019Quan Marcell Love, the executive director of the Virginia NAACP, said the decline in the number of searches of Black drivers shows that the reforms are broadly working. But he said advocates are waiting to see how the situation plays out in the long term. \u201cWe have to give it time to work,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe are not launching a celebration any time soon.\u201d Officers stop about 20 million drivers a year, according to federal estimates, for reasons from speeding to blowing through reds light to expired tags. The vast majority of the encounters last only a few minutes and result in tickets or warnings, research shows. Police across the country have long been criticized for using minor infractions such as broken taillights as reasons to stop motorists and investigate them for possible crimes. Criminologists and civil rights lawyers have panned the tactic as a fishing expedition rife with racial bias that yields few results. Frank Baumgartner, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed more than 24 million traffic stops across North Carolina from 2002 to 2020. He found that the encounters led to arrests about 2 percent of the time. Searches also rarely occurred, and when they did, weapons were discovered in one-tenth of 1 percent of incidents. Black people were the subjects of nearly half the stops, Baumgartner found, even though they are only 21 percent of the state\u2019s population. \u201cFor every one bad guy they catch, they alienate, like, 18 young Black men,\u201d Baumgartner said. \u201cThat's where we get to the crisis of trust with the police.\u201d That type of traffic stop led to two of the highest-profile police killings in recent years: those of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Both were Black men who were shot and killed by officers after having been pulled over for broken taillights. Officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder of Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked coast-to-coast calls for reform. Faced with overwhelming public pressure, elected officials are increasingly moving forward with measures to strip away police powers regardless of whether law enforcement leaders support them. Last month, the top prosecutor in Ramsey County, Minnesota, where Castile was killed, announced that he would no longer prosecute  most cases that stem from non-public-safety traffic stops, such as expired tags. He cited the disproportionate impact on people of color, especially Black people, among other reasons. \u201cThe outcome of these stops is that it yields very, very little contraband,\u201d said the prosecutor, County Attorney John Choi. \u201cIf I thought that this would lead to more problems from a public safety perspective, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Larger police departments in Choi\u2019s county supported the move, but the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association described it as \u201cinsulting.\u201d More statewide bans may be on the horizon as politicians continue to openly shrug off opposition from police. Inspired by the change in Virginia\u2019s law, Joe Nguyen, a Democratic state senator in Washington, recently introduced legislation that would prohibit police from pulling motorists over for failing to stop, driving without licenses and other violations. \u201cWe passed a few bills last year that didn\u2019t have law enforcement support, so it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of,\u201d Nguyen said. Some police chiefs across the country, in places like Oakland, California; Minneapolis; and Portland, Oregon, have retooled their traffic enforcement policies to avoid unnecessary confrontations with drivers. The Oakland Police Department issued a directive five years ago discouraging officers from pulling people over for low-level offenses like equipment violations and expired registrations. Since the policies were put in place, the percentage of Black drivers who were stopped fell from 62 percent in 2016 to 51 percent in 2019. The police department enlisted Stanford University to examine its data, which showed that under 3 percent of stops in 2013 and 2014 were linked to more serious crimes. Deputy Police Chief Christopher Bolton urged Oakland police brass reluctant to reform to take a hard look at the statistics. \u201cWhy are we continuing to do those stops when the data is showing that not only is it not effective and efficient, but it could very well be damaging public trust and confidence in what our strategies are?\u201d Bolton asked. But in San Francisco, District Attorney Chesa Boudin\u2019s push to end \u201cpretextual\u201d traffic stops has met fierce resistance from the police. During his second month in office, Boudin told staff members to refrain from prosecuting people who were stopped for minor infractions and found to have \u201ccontraband,\u201d including drugs and guns. Union officials slammed Boudin for creating an environment in which criminals feel comfortable to break the law without fear of punishment. \u201cIf they want to continue to handcuff the police in doing their jobs, the unintended consequences are going to be more crime victims,\u201d said Tony Montoya, the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Union officials blame Boudin\u2019s new traffic policy for the release of a man who was accused of fatally shooting two people weeks after he was pulled over and found with an assault-style rifle without a serial number. The district attorney\u2019s office said its decision not to pursue charges against the suspect, Robert Newt, had nothing to do with the circumstances of the stop. The investigators didn\u2019t provide DNA or fingerprints that could tie Newt to the gun, Boudin\u2019s office said. Rachel Marshall, a spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office, said the policy \u201coffers room for exceptions.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office said it has rejected about one to two cases a month because of Boudin\u2019s rules, for a total of 11 this year. \u201cRacial profiling undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and fosters distrust in communities of color \u2014 all of which decreases public safety,\u201d Marshall said. Police chiefs and sheriffs in Virginia say that the state\u2019s ban went too far and that it is putting lives at risk at a time when murders and fatal accidents are already soaring. The original bill, in fact, would have gone even further by blocking police from stopping vehicles with no front lights. The governor\u2019s office cut the measure after Chesterfield County Police Chief Jeffrey Katz blasted it in a viral Facebook post. The new law permits a driver to have one broken headlight. \u201cLawmakers were making decisions based on the loudest voices in the room, but not necessarily the most informed voices in the room,\u201d Katz said in an interview. \u201cAnd all you have to do is look at the crime rate in the last year and a half.\u201d As in many other states, the number of murders in Virginia has risen sharply since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Virginia State Police. Even though officers can still cite people for speeding and erratic driving, rural county sheriffs said the ban creates an atmosphere in which reckless motorists feel safe to break the law, and they warned that traffic deaths will rise. Fatal traffic accidents in the six months after the law was changed hit a 10-year high, according to an NBC News analysis that compared them to the same period going back to 2011. Jessica Cowardin, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said the rise in traffic deaths mirrors national figures, which are also up. Federal officials blame the increase on speeding, drunk drivers and people who don\u2019t wear seat belts \u2014 violations that police in Virginia can still enforce. For some Virginia police chiefs, the concerns go beyond traffic accidents. In Petersburg, about 20 miles south of Richmond, officers confiscated more than 1,000 guns in the three years leading up to the ban, often in vehicle stops, Police Chief Travis Christian said. But his office was unable to provide data backing up the claim. The analysis of arrest data found that weapons were discovered in about 7 percent of traffic stops in Petersburg from 2018 to 2020. As a chief who is Black, Christian said he is \u201ctorn\u201d over the new law. He acknowledged that Black Virginians feel targeted by police when they are behind the wheel, but he said he still wants the ban reversed. \u201cIt has given us the ability to use it as an investigative tool to get to other crimes that have been committed,\u201d Christian said. \u201cThat tool has been eliminated for us.\u201d David Weisburd, a criminology professor and the executive director of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, said he wasn\u2019t aware of any data that support the claim that low-level traffic stops help to reduce crime. \u201cIt is time, in my view, for the police to bring evidence to their arguments,\u201d Weisburd said. \u201cThat evidence could help in deciding what is reasonable or unreasonable or what is good policing from what is awful policing.\u201d The new law hasn\u2019t put an end to controversial stops in Virginia. Five days after the ban went into effect, state troopers pulled over Juanisha Brooks, 35, a Black woman who is a senior video producer for the Defense Department, as she was driving along a highway in Northern Virginia. A trooper ordered her to get out of the vehicle several times, saying he wanted to show her what was wrong with her car. Brooks refused, saying she didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t tell her while she remained in the vehicle. Dashcam video appears to show the trooper dragging Brooks out of the seat and pushing her up against her car. Officers charged her with reckless driving, eluding, obstruction of justice and failing to have her headlights on. Prosecutors dropped the case, noting that the stop was illegal because of the reforms. Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, insisted that the arrest was fair because Brooks refused to comply with the trooper\u2019s commands. State Police conducted an internal investigation; Geller said she couldn\u2019t share whether the trooper was disciplined because of privacy rules. \u201cI was afraid for my life,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be another hashtag.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ems-services-warn-crippling-labor-shortage-undermining-911-system-rcna2677", "title": "EMS services warn of 'crippling labor shortage' undermining 911 system", "subtitle": "\u201cWe\u2019re not bleeding any longer \u2014 we\u2019re hemorrhaging,\u201d one ambulance service operator said of a decadelong worker shortage exacerbated by the pandemic.", "author": "By Phil McCausland", "section": null, "body": "The pandemic-induced shortage of emergency medical technicians and paramedics nationwide is so dire that ambulance service providers warn of sharp cuts to services and longer waits for 911 calls \u2014 even when it\u2019s a matter of life or death. Companies have had to close, consolidate or come up with new strategies to answer calls, said American Ambulance Association President Shawn Baird, who added that there is simply not enough EMS personnel to cover calls in many parts of the country, especially during the pandemic. The loss of staff to pandemic-related burnout and low wages has created a vicious cycle, requiring greater dependence on those workers who have stayed on. The situation has deteriorated to such a degree in recent months that ambulance services and industry leaders are pleading with Congress and state legislatures to help. \"The magnitude has really blown up over the last few months,\" Baird said. \"When you take a system that was already fragile and stretched it, because you didn't have enough people entering the field, then you throw a public health emergency and all of the additional burdens that it put on our workforce as well as the labor shortages across the entire economy, and it really has put us in a crisis mode.\" It's a crisis that has made it difficult to hire and even harder to retain EMTs and paramedics, according to a AAA survey of 258 EMS organizations across the country. In 2020, nearly a third of the workforce left their ambulance company after less than a year, the survey said. Eleven percent left within the first three months. \"It's almost unmanageable,\" said Ken Cummings, who leads Tri-Hospital EMS in Port Huron, Michigan. \"I don't think any EMS provider wants to go out in public and say that your service might be interrupted, but the reality is that because of the extremely low workforce situation right now, we are going to start to see delays. We're already seeing that throughout the country right now.\" Cummings said he currently has 10 openings, about 10 percent of his workforce. He's currently paying double overtime to fill the gap left by those empty positions, but that has increased the average work week of his paramedics by at least eight hours. The amount of money he's paying in overtime is also becoming untenable, and his workers are losing interest in the extra cash. \"We're spending money today that we're hoping we get tomorrow, to be real honest with you,\" he said. \"It's not a long-term solution.\" There are an estimated 1,000 open EMS positions in Michigan alone, Cummings said. The good news for Cummings is that he has a handful of students who will graduate next year from the paramedic program, but the churn is constant. The Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, also agreed to allocate $12.9 million of the state's budget to increase reimbursement rates. But that has not slowed the revolving-door nature of the job. Among full-time EMTs, 47 percent reported in 2020 that the reason for leaving was for a career or occupation change, according to the survey. That number is 45 percent among paramedics. \"In my experience running an EMS service, I've seen more than a few employees get into the industry and leave within six months,\" said Judd Smith, the program director of Texas EMS School in Abilene. \"I'll see people work for three weeks and then move on to the next thing.\" The decline in Texas has been particularly substantial. By mid-August, only 27 percent of licensed EMS professionals had submitted a patient care record, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, meaning that over 70 percent of licensed Texas EMTs did not work on an ambulance in the first eight months of the year. That represents a significant drop from the 43 percent of EMTs who submitted reports in 2020 and the 45 percent who did in 2019. The circumstances have pushed the American Ambulance Association and National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians to send a letter to Congress last week pushing for a hearing to address the shortfall and asking for more funding to increase wages. The letter warned that \"our nation\u2019s EMS system is facing a crippling workforce shortage, a long-term problem that has been building for more than a decade. It threatens to undermine our emergency 9-1-1 infrastructure and deserves urgent attention by the Congress.\" The pandemic has made a bad labor problem worse. The spread of the virus, the frequency of calls, worry of potential infection and the necessary safeguards that emergency personnel must take to protect themselves have created additional stress that has caused many to leave the field, providers said. Their departure has then increased the need for those who remain to work overtime, pushing even more to leave the field. The nationwide health emergency also caused many EMT and paramedic courses to shut down, meaning there is a dearth of students coming into the industry. \"We're not bleeding any longer \u2014 we're hemorrhaging,\" said Gary Wadaga, who operates Bay Ambulance in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Ambulance companies have faced years of workforce challenges that has damaged their ability to respond to calls quickly, but the situation is getting worse. Last year, because an ambulance service closed south of his company's service area, Wadaga had to take on an additional 100 square miles of territory. Now he covers 1,500 square miles and receives about 1,000 calls a year with six paramedic positions. The trouble is, he's been unable to fill two spots and has another two workers on leave, leaving him and one other person to respond to every emergency call that comes in. \"I've not seen it this bad in 41 years, and you can't just set that aside,\" said Wadaga, adding that the increasing demands of the job have caused him great anxiety. \"You want to be there for your community, but the fact that one day we're not going to have enough people absolutely bothers me.\" Ambulance companies once had the luxury of considering applicants, but that appears to be a concept of the past. Now companies are actively recruiting and even going after one another's employees because the pool of eligible workers is so small. \"Overall, it's robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Baird, \"because every community needs these folks.\" Wadaga and other ambulance service operators said the pandemic has increased the viciousness of a labor shortage and put the nation's emergency medical system at risk of a \"death spiral\" that could be difficult to pull out of. The salary requests of a shrinking workforce are getting higher as wages remain stagnant. The 2020 median pay for EMTs and paramedics was $36,650 per year or $17.62 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about a 7.5 percent increase since 2011. Advocates said the wages don't match the requirements of the job anymore. \"When you're an EMS provider putting your life on the line and entering into a closed environments with infectious patients and you can make more money to work in an Amazon warehouse, it becomes really difficult to retain people,\" said Robert Luckritz, who serves as chair of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians' EMS Workforce Committee. But it's not just retail and warehouse work that's calling. Luckritz said that hospitals facing their own nursing and health care worker shortages are at times actively recruiting EMT and paramedics, promising higher wages, better hours and increased benefits. That's an issue Luckritz and his colleagues are attempting to work on, but it's a challenge. They need more money to hire more people, but ambulance company rates are set by insurance providers and the government when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, which both contribute to the vast majority of calls, Luckritz said. \"Unlike much of the other industries across the country ... we're not able to raise our prices \u2014 our prices are set by the government,\" he said. \"So with reimbursement not keeping up with our costs, it makes it very difficult for us to compete for the workforce.\" The fear is that if the country doesn't face these problems now, they will be unfixable down the line. Baird, the AAA president, said that if things spiral too far down, \"we can\u2019t get people to even enter the field because it looks too daunting.\" \"We have to turn this around,\" he said. One silver lining is that online EMS programs, such as Smith's Texas EMS School, are seeing increased interest \u2014 even as nationwide there is a decline in enrollment in traditional programs. The number of applications for their EMT program, which can be completed in 10 to 18 weeks via a mix of online coursework and hands-on clinical and field experience, jumped from 495 applicants in 2019 to 1,469 in 2021. The jobs certainly are there waiting for them at graduation. \"I don't know of any one of our students that doesn't get hired within the first week of getting licensed,\" Smith said. \"We've even had a big number of them get hired before they even received their certification, so they start working as soon as they're done.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-stake-2022-hopes-child-cash-benefits-there-s-just-n1281142", "title": "Democrats stake 2022 hopes on child cash benefits.

But in doing so, they planted an election-year time bomb for their own party, and their only realistic hope of defusing it in time is to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s social spending bill. At the center of the American Rescue Plan is a monthly payment structured as a tax credit for the vast majority of families \u2014 of $300 per child under 6 years old or $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. The benefit has been well received in polls, and studies say it quickly lifted millions of U.S. kids out of poverty. But there\u2019s a catch: It is only authorized for 2021. The payments end in December unless extended. With Republicans opposed, the only realistic vehicle to extend them is Biden\u2019s multitrillion-dollar bill, which Democratic leaders are working feverishly to craft. Allowing the payments to expire would risk erasing the economic gains and leaving struggling parents who have come to rely on it in the lurch. Democratic operatives warn it could turn a significant political asset into a liability just months before an election in which Republicans are historically favored to make gains. \u201cLetting the extremely popular child care tax credit expire would be exactly the type of mistake we can\u2019t afford,\u201d Tyler Law, a Democratic consultant who worked for the party\u2019s House election arm during the 2018 blue wave, said. \u201cDemocrats need to deliver win after win after win to show voters we can govern and deserve to stay in power,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet for success, but there\u2019s certainly a recipe for disaster: failing to pass the Biden agenda.\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the child tax credit has had a major impact in alleviating poverty and held it up as an example that says Democrats, when in charge, can help Americans. \u201cThe idea of letting it expire, I think, would be horrific,\u201d he said. While Democrats battle over what provisions make it into the bill, they appear to agree unanimously that the money for kids should be extended \u2014 from centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., to progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. But the details are unclear. The House version of the bill extends the payments through 2025. That may be adjusted as lawmakers sort out how to cut down the plan's price tag to get the centrists on board. And the income threshold for who is eligible may be adjusted as Manchin has demanded additional means-testing for the various programs in the bill. \u201cThere's some differences of opinion about how to do it, and how long to fund it, etcetera. And it has to fit within the overall top line of the bill,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. \u201cBut every Dem really wants it to happen.\u201d Republicans are adamantly opposed to the program and say it should expire. \u201cThe federal government shouldn't be in the business of just handing out money because you have kids,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said. \u201cThat's ridiculous.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Democrats of \u201ctrying to build a permanent welfare class in the country,\u201d saying the child tax credit includes \u201cdistributing more borrowed money to people who don't have a need for it.\u201d Some Democrats are spoiling for that fight. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the party\u2019s House campaign arm, projected confidence that Democrats will pass the bill, extend the child cash payments and then run on them. \u201cWe're going to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact that the Republicans have opposed it at every step of the way will come back to haunt them. I believe that it's exactly that type of thing that is the anvil on which we will hammer them in 2022.\u201d Sean McElwee, a progressive pollster who has been cited by the White House, said his firm has found that voters who received the child cash payment approve of Biden's job performance by a wide margin of 66 percent to 32 percent, whereas voters who haven't gotten it split evenly with 49 percent approving and disapproving. The firm, Data for Progress, found that those who voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020 and who receive the child tax credit register 79 percent disapproval of Biden, whereas 92 percent of those who do not receive it disapprove of the president. \u201cEnding the child tax credit would risk washing away these key persuasion gains that will be necessary to win in 2022 and 2024,\u201d McElwee said. Overall, the child cash payments are supported by 59 percent of U.S. adults, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. That includes 75 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of Republicans. Some of the states with the highest average per-month cash payments are conservative states. Progressives cite the program as an example of how government can make Americans' lives better. \u201cWe already have powerful data showing us that this tax credit is reducing hunger in America. It's providing school shoes and backpacks for kids to be able to go back to school,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u201cWe need to protect this \u2014 not just because it expires in an election year. We need to protect it because this helps American families.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/squid-game-entertaining-world-there-s-different-feeling-south-korea-n1281119", "title": "'Squid Game' is entertaining the world.

Because everyone else is. The nine-episode horror series on Netflix has hit No. 1 in 90 of the streaming service\u2019s markets around the world, including South Korea, where it was made. \u201cI got to the point where I could not hold a conversation without watching the show,\u201d said Jung Dunn, a security analyst in Seoul, the South Korean capital. But the show also strikes a nerve because it unflinchingly addresses a problem that is particularly entrenched in South Korea: debt and the never-ending struggle to pay it off. The cast of \u201cSquid Game\u201d features some of South Korea\u2019s biggest stars, including Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist, Seong Gi-hun, a hopelessly indebted father who receives a business card from a stranger offering him a way out. Along with 455 other contestants \u2014 from all walks of life but all deeply in debt too \u2014 he agrees to compete for a cash prize of 45.6 billion won (about $38 million) by playing a series of traditional Korean children\u2019s games, only to discover that elimination from each round means death. \u201cThere\u2019s this dissonance between Korean pride that this Korean show is dominating Netflix all around the world, and the discomfort with what the show appears to expose about Korea,\u201d said CedarBough Saeji, an assistant professor of Korean and East Asian studies at Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea. \u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing.\u201d That South Korea also produced \u201cParasite,\u201d the 2020 Oscar winner for best picture that also focused on themes of inequality, has probably accentuated this discomfort, Saeji said. Still, \u201cSquid Game\u201d is wildly popular in its home country. The show was released on Sept. 17 just before Chuseok, a Korean holiday similar to Thanksgiving when families gather, the perfect time for binge-watching. The surge in network traffic led one internet service provider to sue Netflix to cover its costs. The fervor has also spilled over into real life. A street vendor in Seoul who provided the makers of \u201cSquid Game\u201d with dalgona, a brittle sugar candy at the center of one of the games, told Reuters that he had seen a boom in business. Thousands of curious South Koreans also tried the eight-digit phone number that appears on the business card, which the show\u2019s makers didn\u2019t realize would reach an actual person. The owner of the number, and even people with similar numbers, have been inundated with calls and messages at all hours. On Wednesday, Netflix said it was working with the show\u2019s local production company to address the issue, including editing scenes to remove the number. Park Sae-ha, a senior studying economics at Yonsei University in Seoul, said \u201cSquid Game\u201d was \u201cspell-binding because it was so explicit and blunt.\u201d \u201cAlthough I am young, I could easily relate to the hard reality of a very competitive society,\u201d she said. That intense competitiveness may be one reason South Korea has been so successful, with a period of rapid industrialization starting in the 1960s that turned it into the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. But as in many other countries, a university degree and a white-collar job don\u2019t guarantee the financial security they used to, Saeji said. With an average income of about $42,000 a year, many Koreans now find they have to borrow to keep up. Fueled by low interest rates, household debt in South Korea has grown significantly in recent years, and is now equal to the country\u2019s annual GDP. (In the U.S., by contrast, household debt is about 80 percent of GDP.) People may rack up debt because of credit card spending, unemployment or gambling losses, but a large chunk of it is tied to real estate. Housing prices have been rising fast, especially under President Moon Jae-in, and the average price of an apartment in Seoul is nearing $1 million. Lending curbs and efforts to cool the housing market have done little to rein in household borrowing. In addition to housing, some Koreans, especially young people, borrow money to invest in cryptocurrency. Many Koreans start out by borrowing from legitimate financial institutions like banks, said Koo Se-Woong, a commentator on Korean culture based in Germany. When that avenue is exhausted, they may move on to second-tier lenders that charge higher interest. In the worst-case scenarios, he said, borrowers turn to loan shark operations that can charge triple-digit interest rates, \u201cand then you are pushed into situations from which you really cannot get out.\u201d According to some estimates, there are 400,000 Koreans in debt to loan sharks. \u201cWhen you look at the characters in the show who are participating in this game, they represent that demographic of the Koreans who are in the worst possible situation because of their personal debt,\u201d Koo said. In a recent widely shared Facebook post, Koo said he was shocked when a friend told him he was living paycheck to paycheck, despite having a good job. The friend \u201cdoesn't strike anyone as extravagant,\u201d Koo said, but struggles to afford the trappings of middle-class life: an apartment, a car and occasional travel with his wife and children. \"It's all paid for by loans, I am telling you,\" Koo said his friend told him. \"We just have no money.\" Jung, the security analyst, said the plot of \u201cSquid Game\u201d was easy to accept because \u201cit dealt with such familiar stories of debt-ridden people you come across in real life.\u201d \u201cThe story stems from a deeply rooted perception of how society looks at failure, especially individual financial failure,\u201d he said. Bankruptcy in South Korea is generally seen not as a chance to start over but as a devastating fate. That is underlined in \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Saeji said, when contestants are given the option to leave but choose to keep playing even at the risk of their lives. \u201cIn the regular world it\u2019s not just the death of their body, it\u2019s the death of their pride. It\u2019s the shame of having to be such an unsuccessful person in front of your family,\u201d she said. Viewers in South Korea say the show is all the more disturbing because it injects death and violence into playground games like Red Light, Green Light and tug of war. The show plays on childhood nostalgia \u201cand along with it the innocent times when you had no problems,\u201d said Kim Hern-sik, a pop culture critic in Seoul. \u201cYet the story tells you that escaping from reality is not the answer.\u201d \u201cSquid Game\u201d is \u201cfundamentally a Korean story, featuring games people would remember playing as kids,\u201d Don Kang, vice president of Korean content at Netflix, told NBC News in an email. \u201cSo we knew it would resonate with our members here.\u201d Its popularity in the West came as more of a surprise. But Korean cultural exports have been sweeping Asia for years, and Netflix was already betting on their growing appeal. The company is spending $500 million this year on Korean content, almost as much as it spent in the last five years. Saeji said that after decades of Western cultural influence, the success of \u201cSquid Game\u201d shows that South Korea can make a TV show with a Hollywood feel \u201cand they can do it better.\u201d While \u201cSquid Game\u201d is not the first story about a fight to the death, director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who has a film degree from the University of Southern California, made it influential in his own way, said Oh Dong-jin, a prominent film critic in South Korea. \u201cEvery movie borrows this and that from other movies. What matters, therefore, is how creatively you can borrow from different references,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, even from this standpoint, the traditional children\u2019s games the show uses make 'Squid Game' quite original.\u201d Margie Kim, a housewife in Seoul who is watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d with her family, said that while she enjoyed its intensity and pop-art-influenced visuals, the underlying messages were also important. \u201cI do feel the pain of what our society is going through,\u201d she said. The show deals with so many pressing issues, she said\u2014income inequality, youth unemployment, a rapidly aging society\u2014that it\u2019s something her entire family can relate to and talk about. \u201cSo many middle-class, ordinary people live with so much debt,\u201d she said. \u201cI could totally empathize with people who joined the game.\u201d Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Stella Kim reported from Los Angeles.", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/working-companies-owned-well-heeled-private-equity-firms-can-mean-n1281146", "title": "Working for companies owned by well-heeled private-equity firms can mean lower wages for employees", "subtitle": "Workers at some fast-food chains owned by public firms are getting better wages now. It\u2019s a different story at restaurants owned by private-equity firms.", "author": "By Gretchen Morgenson", "section": null, "body": "Alma Jordan, a certified nursing assistant at the Marcella Center nursing home in Burlington, New Jersey, respected the residents she cared for there over the past 16 years. They were like family, she said, and she believes they\u2019ve appreciated her attentiveness, especially during Covid-19. Not so, the nursing home\u2019s new owner, Jordan said. After Complete Care Management, the largest for-profit nursing home operator in New Jersey, took over the 150-bed Marcella Center in April, it slashed worker benefits, she and other employees as well as a representative from their union told NBC News. Amid the pandemic, Jordan\u2019s paid holidays were reduced, and her monthly health insurance costs more than tripled, she said. The company stopped contributing to the employee pension, replacing it with a 401(k) plan that had no employer match or contribution. Complete Care took away vision insurance and stopped a reimbursement program covering employee education costs, so Jordan, 45, won\u2019t be able to recoup money she spent working toward a degree to become a licensed practical nurse. \u201cI put all my effort into this company, and someone else took over and they don\u2019t want to give us what we deserve,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s business. It\u2019s not about the staff and the residents. It\u2019s only about making profits.\u201d In late September, Jordan quit her position at the facility. The reduced benefits and deteriorating work conditions got to be too much, she said. When Complete Care came in, Jordan and other Marcella workers were operating under a union contract struck with the facility\u2019s previous owner. Complete Care did away with that contract, which also covered four other unionized New Jersey nursing facilities it recently acquired, according to the Service Employees International Union. Complete Care owns 61 facilities in eight states, including Connecticut, Maryland and Wisconsin. It is backed by a private-equity firm called Peace Capital in Lakewood, New Jersey, whose principal owner is Sam Stein. Jordan and her fellow workers are not alone in experiencing reduced circumstances after their company is taken over by a private-equity firm. The new titans of finance, these firms use large pools of debt \u2014 typically raised in what's called the leveraged loan market \u2014 to acquire companies they hope to resell in a few years at a profit. Among companies raising money in this loan market during the past three years, debt levels at private-equity-backed entities were at least 30 percent higher than debt levels at companies not backed by private equity, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. But the heavy debt loads they take on, combined with pressure to flip acquired companies quickly, increases the likelihood that private-equity firms will have to cut costs in the operations that they buy. Often, the first to the chopping block is the company\u2019s workforce. A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research lays this out. Researchers analyzed almost 10,000 debt-fueled buyouts between 1980 and 2013 and found that employment fell by 13 percent when a private-equity firm took over a public company. Employment declined by even more \u2014 16 percent \u2014 when private equity acquired a unit or division of a company. Eileen Appelbaum is an economist and co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, and co-author of \"Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street.\" Her study of private equity has led her to conclude that the industry\u2019s growing clout is not only a concern for workers, but also has the potential to harm the nation\u2019s broader economy. \u201cYou have a lot more ownership of productive resources by investors who don\u2019t know an industry, don\u2019t understand the value of skilled workers and who are just in it to make their profit and get out,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cThat erodes productivity.\u201d Almost 12 million employees, or roughly 7 percent of the U.S. labor force, work for private-equity-backed businesses, according to the American Investment Council, an industry lobbying group. These companies generated about 6.5 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product last year, the group said. The council said private-equity firms create jobs, support businesses and help provide comfortable retirements for pensioners invested in the strategy. A spokeswoman for Complete Care echoed this view. She said the company is committed to the long-term viability of its facilities, adding in a statement: \u201cWe offer a comprehensive health plan and competitive benefits, and our facilities are known as great places to work.\u201d The company is negotiating a new union contract, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, though, care at the Marcella facility is declining, Jordan said, days after she quit. \u201cWe were very short-staffed,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think the residents pick up on that because it takes longer to answer a call.\u201d In a statement, a spokesperson for Complete Care said, \u201cComplete Care at Marcella consistently maintains state mandated ratios. ... We take whatever measures necessary to ensure that we have proper staffing to meet the needs of those in our care, including bringing in agency staff and offering bonuses as needed.\" Private equity is a sophisticated investment strategy that has grown furiously in recent years. At the end of last year, assets under management at the firms worldwide stood at $5 trillion, up from $1.5 trillion over the past decade, according to Preqin, a financial data provider. The number of funds devoted to these activities has more than doubled during that period, and last year, private-equity firms paid some $600 billion to acquire companies, up from $250 billion 10 years earlier. Private-equity firms began their climb to power in the 1980s; then they were known as leveraged buyout shops, because of the debt they use. The $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988 by private-equity giant Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts brought such deals to center stage. In recent years, as prevailing interest rates collapsed, private-equity operations have been able to take on greater amounts of low-cost debt to make their acquisitions. Through Sept. 27, for example, $472 billion of leveraged loans were issued, up from $237 billion issued during the same period in 2019, according to LCD of S&P Global. Outside investors, such as public pension funds and endowments, pour money into these takeover deals in the hopes of generating high returns. But recently, as the stock market has roared, outsize returns in private equity have all but vanished, academic studies show, and they are now in line with overall market performance. Nevertheless, more companies are owned by private-equity firms now than trade on the nation\u2019s stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, private-equity firms\u2019 rising dominance has generated immense wealth for their executives. The value of Sam Stein's holdings in Complete Care could not be determined and the company declined to provide it, but it is almost certainly dwarfed by those of Stephen Schwarzman, head of Blackstone Group. A close adviser to Donald Trump during his presidency, Schwarzman is worth $35 billion, according to Forbes magazine, up from $15 billion in 2020. Private equity also benefited from recent government interventions related to the Covid pandemic, documents show. At least $5 billion in federal bailout money went to companies backed by large and well-capitalized private-equity firms, according to a recent report from Americans for Financial Reform. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board launched an unprecedented $750 billion program to prop up the corporate bond market, where many of these firms raise money for their buyouts. Among the bonds purchased by the Fed, documents show, were those issued by Blackstone and another private-equity giant, Apollo Global Management, founded by Leon Black. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently testified that the agency would increase its scrutiny on fee disclosures and conflicts of interest among private funds, to ensure their practices don't put investors in these strategies at a disadvantage. And Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a late September memo outlining the agency's priorities that \"the growing role of private equity\" invites an examination of how these firms' business models \"may facilitate unfair methods of competition and consumer protection violations.\" Finally, the Democrats\u2019 proposed tax increase on capital gains may crimp private-equity executives\u2019 earnings. A key reason many of these executives have been able to amass such fortunes is that so much of their earnings are taxed as capital gains with a top rate of 20 percent, not at the higher 37 percent rate that can apply to income. This is a benefit they've tapped for decades, often allowing them to pay a lower tax rate on earnings than a secretary or a teacher might. One of the nation\u2019s biggest private-equity employers is Roark Capital of Atlanta. It owns Inspire Brands \u2014 parent company to an array of fast-food chains that includes Arby\u2019s, Dunkin\u2019, Baskin-Robbins and Sonic \u2014 and other brands such as Cinnabon and Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee. NBC News estimates that more than 700,000 people work at Inspire Brands, many at independently owned franchise stores. Roark is named for the libertarian protagonist in \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d by Ayn Rand, whose life \u201cexemplified the qualities of independence and integrity,\u201d the company\u2019s website said. One of libertarianism's basic tenets is limited government, but three dozen companies owned by Roark obtained $183 million in federal assistance under the CARES Act, according to the Americans for Financial Reform report. Asked whether this acceptance of government funding ran counter to a limited government stance, Roark declined to comment through a spokeswoman. Zella Roberts, a recent graduate of Warren Wilson College near Asheville, North Carolina, worked as a carhop at a Sonic Drive-In earlier this year to help pay tuition. Her all-in pay plummeted during the pandemic, Roberts told NBC News, because customers\u2019 cash usage fell and Sonic did not allow tips on credit cards. Roberts said she and some colleagues sent an email to Roark Capital \"explaining the conditions that Sonic workers experience. The big ask was to put pressure on Sonic corporate to make these changes.\" She said she never heard back about that or other messages sent to Neal Aronson, managing partner and founder of Roark Capital. Aronson is the controlling owner of Roark, regulatory filings show, which has $18.6 billion in assets under management. Through a spokeswoman, Aronson declined to comment. In January, after Roberts had collected 7,800 signatures on a petition asking Roark to change its policy, the company allowed tips on credit card orders placed through its app. An improvement, Roberts acknowledged, but such orders are a small percentage of those made via credit cards, she pointed out. The Inspire Brands spokesman said barring tips on credit cards \u201cis a technology limitation that we inherited when we purchased the brand\u201d in 2018. \u201cWe are now working on implementing the credit card tipping capability,\u201d he said. Inspire Brands has also worked to battle the Raise the Wage Act, which has been introduced in Congress every year since 2017 and would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour among workers like Roberts. In March, Inspire sent a memo to franchise owners highlighting its lobbying success in opposing the change. Describing its efforts, Inspire said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you\u2019re on the menu, and you can guarantee your opponents are eating!\u201d Chris Fuller, a spokesman for Inspire Brands, said the company fought the national minimum wage legislation because \u201cwe don\u2019t support a one-size-fits-all approach to the minimum wage. We believe in letting the local markets dictate.\u201d He added: \u201cMore than 90 percent of our team members at corporate-owned restaurants are above the state or local minimum wage.\u201d Some Inspire Brands workers have taken matters into their own hands. This summer, Matthew Honeycutt, 18, was working at an Arby\u2019s in Charlotte, North Carolina, making $9.50 an hour as a shift manager. He supports an 8-month-old son. On July 20, he and a group of workers walked off the job seeking a pay raise, forcing managers to close the Arby\u2019s store two hours early, Honeycutt said. That got management\u2019s attention, he said. \u201cThe strike was on a Tuesday, and it was about Thursday when he started getting the raises out,\u201d Honeycutt said of his boss, who gave him a 50-cents-an-hour raise. \"Every kind of worker you can think of is working so hard, but they're not getting paid what they\u2019re worth.\" Honeycutt\u2019s boss did not respond to a voicemail message seeking comment. In mid-September, Honeycutt quit his job at Arby's for a higher-paying position elsewhere. While Inspire Brands fights against a higher minimum wage, some other restaurant companies owned by publicly traded companies are taking a different approach. They say increasing worker pay is good for business. In February, Robert Verostek, the chief financial officer of restaurant chain Denny\u2019s, told investors that paying a higher wage to its workers in California had resulted in \u201cnot just positive sales, but positive guest traffic.\u201d And in May, McDonald's began increasing pay by 10 percent for almost 37,000 workers in company-owned stores. Shift managers like Honeycutt, who earned $10 at Arby\u2019s, are earning between $15 and $20 an hour depending on the location, McDonald\u2019s said. Sean Dunlop, an equity analyst at Morningstar Research, said Inspire Brands is a well-managed company. But increasing pay and benefits among workers is an industry trend it won't be able to resist. \"As you\u2019re thinking about bigger chains, not only are they making a broader push to a $15 average wage at restaurants, you\u2019ve also seen them offer tuition assistance, paid time off, retention bonuses and referral bonuses as they\u2019ve been trying to attract workers,\" Dunlop said. \"Inspire Brands, if they want to compete, are going to be forced to raise wages.

In one hour, 193 people waited patiently to fill their carts and shopping bags with produce like bell peppers, apples, onions and squash from the side of a massive truck. \u201cThat\u2019s a record for this year,\u201d said Matthew Durkin, 30, the mobile distribution supervisor, while nodding at the clients and noting that he usually sees only about 160 people. \u201cIt means there\u2019s an increased need.\u201d Durkin, of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, says that while demand for free food has slowed slightly from the start of the pandemic, people are still hungry. \u201cWe have seen another jump in numbers within the last few months. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, adding that many clients have told them how much they fear returning to work. \"They are concerned about Covid-19 surges, as so many of us are, and some of them may need to stay available for unexpected changes in child care and school due to Covid exposures or cases.\u201d More than 18 months into the pandemic, San Francisco Bay Area nonprofit organizations, from food banks to shelters for domestic violence victims, say that they are seeing more demand for their services than they ever saw before the pandemic. Even now, there are still two members of the California National Guard working at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties\u2019 central warehouse in Fairfield. As the pandemic drags on, these support facilities are also struggling with supply chain problems to meet the seemingly endless demand. It presents even more challenges as supplies and workers grow more scarce. Joel Sjostrom, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, has watched the food bank\u2019s demand grow to 300,000 people at the height of the pandemic from 178,000 before the pandemic began. He is now still trying to find support for 240,000 clients each month. Almost immediately after the March 2020 shelter-in-place order was instituted, he said, his organization lost 35 percent of its volunteer workforce because it depends so heavily on older volunteers who were scared to work before they were vaccinated. He had to call in members of the California National Guard, two of which remain. \u201cTo meet those volume increases, we have had to step up facilities and transportation,\u201d Sjostrom added. \u201cI had heard of the National Guard being helpful to others in Southern California.\u201d At one point, there were as many as 25 soldiers working to help this one bank. In California, the National Guard, as of Thursday, still had 140 soldiers deployed to food banks across 16 counties, down from a high of 767 in April 2020, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan M. Shiroma, a California National Guard spokesperson. But the National Guard is gradually trying to cut those numbers back and deploy these workers to other missions. In addition to help from the National Guard, Sjostrom has hired more full-time staff. But even now, even with 16 drivers, he still would like four more \u201cClass A\u201d drivers who can operate big rig trucks. In order to stay competitive with other outfits that employ drivers, he said he has had to raise his rates from $28 per hour to $30 per hour. \u201cIt\u2019s truly market pressure,\u201d Sjostrom said. \u201cAmazon has ads out, as does Hello Fresh, and driver demand is everywhere.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/traffic-stops-are-flashpoint-policing-america-reformers-are-winning-big-n1280594", "title": "Police face a 'crisis of trust' with Black motorists.

Police chiefs aren't happy.", "author": "By Simone Weichselbaum, Emily R. Siegel and Andrew Blankstein", "section": null, "body": "In the months after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, public defenders in Virginia saw an opportunity to overhaul policing in the state. Among their key priorities to address racial disparities: a ban on traffic stops for such infractions as broken taillights, tinted windows and the aroma of marijuana. What happened next stunned police officials across Virginia. In just three months, the ban the public defenders pitched to Democratic legislators sailed to the governor\u2019s desk and was signed into law. With Covid-19 shutting down the state Capitol and forcing the legislative sessions to take place via Zoom, the law enforcement officials who objected to the bill had failed to galvanize the opposition. In March, Virginia became the first state to prohibit the kind of low-level traffic stops that disproportionately affect people of color and are often used as pretexts to search for drugs and weapons. An NBC News analysis of the early data shows that the measure is having an impact on the percentage of Black motorists searched by police during traffic stops. \u201cAs public defenders, we aren\u2019t exactly used to winning, let alone winning big,\u201d said Brad Haywood, the chief public defender for Arlington County and executive director of Justice Forward, a criminal justice reform organization made up of public defenders across the state. \u201cThis will dramatically reduce race-based policing and impact so many lives.\u201d Long a cornerstone of American law enforcement, the traffic stop has emerged as a flashpoint in the debate over police reform. Over the last 20 months, district attorneys in California and Minnesota have ordered prosecutors to drop cases in which officers found guns or drugs during traffic stops for minor infractions. Other states, including Washington and Massachusetts, are considering restrictions similar to Virginia\u2019s. Proponents describe the measures as a long overdue step in banishing a tactic that targets mainly Black drivers and fails to improve public safety. But many law enforcement officials argue that they\u2019re being stripped of a crucial tool that they say helps to reduce vehicle deaths and remove criminals, guns and drugs from the streets, although the police chiefs and sheriffs interviewed for this article struggled to provide data backing up their case. Maggie DeBoard, the chief of the Herndon Police Department in Virginia, said stripping police of the ability to make certain traffic stops will make the roads more susceptible to traffic accidents and create fewer opportunities for officers to encounter people who should be off the streets. \u201cWe are eliminating more and more interactions with criminals by not allowing us to enforce the laws that are on the books,\u201d said DeBoard, who was the president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police as the group fought the bill. \u201cA lot of times you stop a vehicle, you have no idea the race, color, creed, religion of the person you're stopping,\u201d DeBoard said. \u201cYou see a violation, you stop the car. And at night, you definitely don\u2019t know who you\u2019re stopping. So it is not about targeting.\u201d Virginia started collecting detailed traffic stop statistics only in June 2020. The early data suggest that the law is having some effect on how the roads are policed. In the first four months after the law was enacted \u2014 March to June \u2014 the number of overall traffic stops rose by 7 percent compared to the previous four months, which experts said isn\u2019t surprising given that warmer weather tends to attract more drivers to the roads. But the number of motorists subjected to searches after having been pulled over \u2014 the category that the reformers care about most \u2014 dropped sharply, according to an NBC News analysis of police data obtained in a public records request. The number of Black drivers who were searched fell by 40 percent, and the number of white drivers dropped by 30 percent, the data show. Black people still accounted for about 30 percent of all traffic stops \u2014 the same percentage as before the law was changed \u2014 even though they are about 20 percent of the population of Virginia. White people, who make up 65 percent of the population, accounted for slightly under 65 percent of the stops before and after the law was changed, the early data show. Da\u2019Quan Marcell Love, the executive director of the Virginia NAACP, said the decline in the number of searches of Black drivers shows that the reforms are broadly working. But he said advocates are waiting to see how the situation plays out in the long term. \u201cWe have to give it time to work,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe are not launching a celebration any time soon.\u201d Officers stop about 20 million drivers a year, according to federal estimates, for reasons from speeding to blowing through reds light to expired tags. The vast majority of the encounters last only a few minutes and result in tickets or warnings, research shows. Police across the country have long been criticized for using minor infractions such as broken taillights as reasons to stop motorists and investigate them for possible crimes. Criminologists and civil rights lawyers have panned the tactic as a fishing expedition rife with racial bias that yields few results. Frank Baumgartner, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed more than 24 million traffic stops across North Carolina from 2002 to 2020. He found that the encounters led to arrests about 2 percent of the time. Searches also rarely occurred, and when they did, weapons were discovered in one-tenth of 1 percent of incidents. Black people were the subjects of nearly half the stops, Baumgartner found, even though they are only 21 percent of the state\u2019s population. \u201cFor every one bad guy they catch, they alienate, like, 18 young Black men,\u201d Baumgartner said. \u201cThat's where we get to the crisis of trust with the police.\u201d That type of traffic stop led to two of the highest-profile police killings in recent years: those of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Both were Black men who were shot and killed by officers after having been pulled over for broken taillights. Officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder of Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked coast-to-coast calls for reform. Faced with overwhelming public pressure, elected officials are increasingly moving forward with measures to strip away police powers regardless of whether law enforcement leaders support them. Last month, the top prosecutor in Ramsey County, Minnesota, where Castile was killed, announced that he would no longer prosecute  most cases that stem from non-public-safety traffic stops, such as expired tags. He cited the disproportionate impact on people of color, especially Black people, among other reasons. \u201cThe outcome of these stops is that it yields very, very little contraband,\u201d said the prosecutor, County Attorney John Choi. \u201cIf I thought that this would lead to more problems from a public safety perspective, I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Larger police departments in Choi\u2019s county supported the move, but the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association described it as \u201cinsulting.\u201d More statewide bans may be on the horizon as politicians continue to openly shrug off opposition from police. Inspired by the change in Virginia\u2019s law, Joe Nguyen, a Democratic state senator in Washington, recently introduced legislation that would prohibit police from pulling motorists over for failing to stop, driving without licenses and other violations. \u201cWe passed a few bills last year that didn\u2019t have law enforcement support, so it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of,\u201d Nguyen said. Some police chiefs across the country, in places like Oakland, California; Minneapolis; and Portland, Oregon, have retooled their traffic enforcement policies to avoid unnecessary confrontations with drivers. The Oakland Police Department issued a directive five years ago discouraging officers from pulling people over for low-level offenses like equipment violations and expired registrations. Since the policies were put in place, the percentage of Black drivers who were stopped fell from 62 percent in 2016 to 51 percent in 2019. The police department enlisted Stanford University to examine its data, which showed that under 3 percent of stops in 2013 and 2014 were linked to more serious crimes. Deputy Police Chief Christopher Bolton urged Oakland police brass reluctant to reform to take a hard look at the statistics. \u201cWhy are we continuing to do those stops when the data is showing that not only is it not effective and efficient, but it could very well be damaging public trust and confidence in what our strategies are?\u201d Bolton asked. But in San Francisco, District Attorney Chesa Boudin\u2019s push to end \u201cpretextual\u201d traffic stops has met fierce resistance from the police. During his second month in office, Boudin told staff members to refrain from prosecuting people who were stopped for minor infractions and found to have \u201ccontraband,\u201d including drugs and guns. Union officials slammed Boudin for creating an environment in which criminals feel comfortable to break the law without fear of punishment. \u201cIf they want to continue to handcuff the police in doing their jobs, the unintended consequences are going to be more crime victims,\u201d said Tony Montoya, the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association. Union officials blame Boudin\u2019s new traffic policy for the release of a man who was accused of fatally shooting two people weeks after he was pulled over and found with an assault-style rifle without a serial number. The district attorney\u2019s office said its decision not to pursue charges against the suspect, Robert Newt, had nothing to do with the circumstances of the stop. The investigators didn\u2019t provide DNA or fingerprints that could tie Newt to the gun, Boudin\u2019s office said. Rachel Marshall, a spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office, said the policy \u201coffers room for exceptions.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office said it has rejected about one to two cases a month because of Boudin\u2019s rules, for a total of 11 this year. \u201cRacial profiling undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and fosters distrust in communities of color \u2014 all of which decreases public safety,\u201d Marshall said. Police chiefs and sheriffs in Virginia say that the state\u2019s ban went too far and that it is putting lives at risk at a time when murders and fatal accidents are already soaring. The original bill, in fact, would have gone even further by blocking police from stopping vehicles with no front lights. The governor\u2019s office cut the measure after Chesterfield County Police Chief Jeffrey Katz blasted it in a viral Facebook post. The new law permits a driver to have one broken headlight. \u201cLawmakers were making decisions based on the loudest voices in the room, but not necessarily the most informed voices in the room,\u201d Katz said in an interview. \u201cAnd all you have to do is look at the crime rate in the last year and a half.\u201d As in many other states, the number of murders in Virginia has risen sharply since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Virginia State Police. Even though officers can still cite people for speeding and erratic driving, rural county sheriffs said the ban creates an atmosphere in which reckless motorists feel safe to break the law, and they warned that traffic deaths will rise. Fatal traffic accidents in the six months after the law was changed hit a 10-year high, according to an NBC News analysis that compared them to the same period going back to 2011. Jessica Cowardin, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said the rise in traffic deaths mirrors national figures, which are also up. Federal officials blame the increase on speeding, drunk drivers and people who don\u2019t wear seat belts \u2014 violations that police in Virginia can still enforce. For some Virginia police chiefs, the concerns go beyond traffic accidents. In Petersburg, about 20 miles south of Richmond, officers confiscated more than 1,000 guns in the three years leading up to the ban, often in vehicle stops, Police Chief Travis Christian said. But his office was unable to provide data backing up the claim. The analysis of arrest data found that weapons were discovered in about 7 percent of traffic stops in Petersburg from 2018 to 2020. As a chief who is Black, Christian said he is \u201ctorn\u201d over the new law. He acknowledged that Black Virginians feel targeted by police when they are behind the wheel, but he said he still wants the ban reversed. \u201cIt has given us the ability to use it as an investigative tool to get to other crimes that have been committed,\u201d Christian said. \u201cThat tool has been eliminated for us.\u201d David Weisburd, a criminology professor and the executive director of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, said he wasn\u2019t aware of any data that support the claim that low-level traffic stops help to reduce crime. \u201cIt is time, in my view, for the police to bring evidence to their arguments,\u201d Weisburd said. \u201cThat evidence could help in deciding what is reasonable or unreasonable or what is good policing from what is awful policing.\u201d The new law hasn\u2019t put an end to controversial stops in Virginia. Five days after the ban went into effect, state troopers pulled over Juanisha Brooks, 35, a Black woman who is a senior video producer for the Defense Department, as she was driving along a highway in Northern Virginia. A trooper ordered her to get out of the vehicle several times, saying he wanted to show her what was wrong with her car. Brooks refused, saying she didn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t tell her while she remained in the vehicle. Dashcam video appears to show the trooper dragging Brooks out of the seat and pushing her up against her car. Officers charged her with reckless driving, eluding, obstruction of justice and failing to have her headlights on. Prosecutors dropped the case, noting that the stop was illegal because of the reforms. Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, insisted that the arrest was fair because Brooks refused to comply with the trooper\u2019s commands. State Police conducted an internal investigation; Geller said she couldn\u2019t share whether the trooper was disciplined because of privacy rules. \u201cI was afraid for my life,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be another hashtag.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ems-services-warn-crippling-labor-shortage-undermining-911-system-rcna2677", "title": "EMS services warn of 'crippling labor shortage' undermining 911 system", "subtitle": "\u201cWe\u2019re not bleeding any longer \u2014 we\u2019re hemorrhaging,\u201d one ambulance service operator said of a decadelong worker shortage exacerbated by the pandemic.", "author": "By Phil McCausland", "section": null, "body": "The pandemic-induced shortage of emergency medical technicians and paramedics nationwide is so dire that ambulance service providers warn of sharp cuts to services and longer waits for 911 calls \u2014 even when it\u2019s a matter of life or death. Companies have had to close, consolidate or come up with new strategies to answer calls, said American Ambulance Association President Shawn Baird, who added that there is simply not enough EMS personnel to cover calls in many parts of the country, especially during the pandemic. The loss of staff to pandemic-related burnout and low wages has created a vicious cycle, requiring greater dependence on those workers who have stayed on. The situation has deteriorated to such a degree in recent months that ambulance services and industry leaders are pleading with Congress and state legislatures to help. \"The magnitude has really blown up over the last few months,\" Baird said. \"When you take a system that was already fragile and stretched it, because you didn't have enough people entering the field, then you throw a public health emergency and all of the additional burdens that it put on our workforce as well as the labor shortages across the entire economy, and it really has put us in a crisis mode.\" It's a crisis that has made it difficult to hire and even harder to retain EMTs and paramedics, according to a AAA survey of 258 EMS organizations across the country. In 2020, nearly a third of the workforce left their ambulance company after less than a year, the survey said. Eleven percent left within the first three months. \"It's almost unmanageable,\" said Ken Cummings, who leads Tri-Hospital EMS in Port Huron, Michigan. \"I don't think any EMS provider wants to go out in public and say that your service might be interrupted, but the reality is that because of the extremely low workforce situation right now, we are going to start to see delays. We're already seeing that throughout the country right now.\" Cummings said he currently has 10 openings, about 10 percent of his workforce. He's currently paying double overtime to fill the gap left by those empty positions, but that has increased the average work week of his paramedics by at least eight hours. The amount of money he's paying in overtime is also becoming untenable, and his workers are losing interest in the extra cash. \"We're spending money today that we're hoping we get tomorrow, to be real honest with you,\" he said. \"It's not a long-term solution.\" There are an estimated 1,000 open EMS positions in Michigan alone, Cummings said. The good news for Cummings is that he has a handful of students who will graduate next year from the paramedic program, but the churn is constant. The Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, also agreed to allocate $12.9 million of the state's budget to increase reimbursement rates. But that has not slowed the revolving-door nature of the job. Among full-time EMTs, 47 percent reported in 2020 that the reason for leaving was for a career or occupation change, according to the survey. That number is 45 percent among paramedics. \"In my experience running an EMS service, I've seen more than a few employees get into the industry and leave within six months,\" said Judd Smith, the program director of Texas EMS School in Abilene. \"I'll see people work for three weeks and then move on to the next thing.\" The decline in Texas has been particularly substantial. By mid-August, only 27 percent of licensed EMS professionals had submitted a patient care record, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, meaning that over 70 percent of licensed Texas EMTs did not work on an ambulance in the first eight months of the year. That represents a significant drop from the 43 percent of EMTs who submitted reports in 2020 and the 45 percent who did in 2019. The circumstances have pushed the American Ambulance Association and National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians to send a letter to Congress last week pushing for a hearing to address the shortfall and asking for more funding to increase wages. The letter warned that \"our nation\u2019s EMS system is facing a crippling workforce shortage, a long-term problem that has been building for more than a decade. It threatens to undermine our emergency 9-1-1 infrastructure and deserves urgent attention by the Congress.\" The pandemic has made a bad labor problem worse. The spread of the virus, the frequency of calls, worry of potential infection and the necessary safeguards that emergency personnel must take to protect themselves have created additional stress that has caused many to leave the field, providers said. Their departure has then increased the need for those who remain to work overtime, pushing even more to leave the field. The nationwide health emergency also caused many EMT and paramedic courses to shut down, meaning there is a dearth of students coming into the industry. \"We're not bleeding any longer \u2014 we're hemorrhaging,\" said Gary Wadaga, who operates Bay Ambulance in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Ambulance companies have faced years of workforce challenges that has damaged their ability to respond to calls quickly, but the situation is getting worse. Last year, because an ambulance service closed south of his company's service area, Wadaga had to take on an additional 100 square miles of territory. Now he covers 1,500 square miles and receives about 1,000 calls a year with six paramedic positions. The trouble is, he's been unable to fill two spots and has another two workers on leave, leaving him and one other person to respond to every emergency call that comes in. \"I've not seen it this bad in 41 years, and you can't just set that aside,\" said Wadaga, adding that the increasing demands of the job have caused him great anxiety. \"You want to be there for your community, but the fact that one day we're not going to have enough people absolutely bothers me.\" Ambulance companies once had the luxury of considering applicants, but that appears to be a concept of the past. Now companies are actively recruiting and even going after one another's employees because the pool of eligible workers is so small. \"Overall, it's robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Baird, \"because every community needs these folks.\" Wadaga and other ambulance service operators said the pandemic has increased the viciousness of a labor shortage and put the nation's emergency medical system at risk of a \"death spiral\" that could be difficult to pull out of. The salary requests of a shrinking workforce are getting higher as wages remain stagnant. The 2020 median pay for EMTs and paramedics was $36,650 per year or $17.62 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about a 7.5 percent increase since 2011. Advocates said the wages don't match the requirements of the job anymore. \"When you're an EMS provider putting your life on the line and entering into a closed environments with infectious patients and you can make more money to work in an Amazon warehouse, it becomes really difficult to retain people,\" said Robert Luckritz, who serves as chair of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians' EMS Workforce Committee. But it's not just retail and warehouse work that's calling. Luckritz said that hospitals facing their own nursing and health care worker shortages are at times actively recruiting EMT and paramedics, promising higher wages, better hours and increased benefits. That's an issue Luckritz and his colleagues are attempting to work on, but it's a challenge. They need more money to hire more people, but ambulance company rates are set by insurance providers and the government when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, which both contribute to the vast majority of calls, Luckritz said. \"Unlike much of the other industries across the country ... we're not able to raise our prices \u2014 our prices are set by the government,\" he said. \"So with reimbursement not keeping up with our costs, it makes it very difficult for us to compete for the workforce.\" The fear is that if the country doesn't face these problems now, they will be unfixable down the line. Baird, the AAA president, said that if things spiral too far down, \"we can\u2019t get people to even enter the field because it looks too daunting.\" \"We have to turn this around,\" he said. One silver lining is that online EMS programs, such as Smith's Texas EMS School, are seeing increased interest \u2014 even as nationwide there is a decline in enrollment in traditional programs. The number of applications for their EMT program, which can be completed in 10 to 18 weeks via a mix of online coursework and hands-on clinical and field experience, jumped from 495 applicants in 2019 to 1,469 in 2021. The jobs certainly are there waiting for them at graduation. \"I don't know of any one of our students that doesn't get hired within the first week of getting licensed,\" Smith said. \"We've even had a big number of them get hired before they even received their certification, so they start working as soon as they're done.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-stake-2022-hopes-child-cash-benefits-there-s-just-n1281142", "title": "Democrats stake 2022 hopes on child cash benefits.

But in doing so, they planted an election-year time bomb for their own party, and their only realistic hope of defusing it in time is to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s social spending bill. At the center of the American Rescue Plan is a monthly payment structured as a tax credit for the vast majority of families \u2014 of $300 per child under 6 years old or $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. The benefit has been well received in polls, and studies say it quickly lifted millions of U.S. kids out of poverty. But there\u2019s a catch: It is only authorized for 2021. The payments end in December unless extended. With Republicans opposed, the only realistic vehicle to extend them is Biden\u2019s multitrillion-dollar bill, which Democratic leaders are working feverishly to craft. Allowing the payments to expire would risk erasing the economic gains and leaving struggling parents who have come to rely on it in the lurch. Democratic operatives warn it could turn a significant political asset into a liability just months before an election in which Republicans are historically favored to make gains. \u201cLetting the extremely popular child care tax credit expire would be exactly the type of mistake we can\u2019t afford,\u201d Tyler Law, a Democratic consultant who worked for the party\u2019s House election arm during the 2018 blue wave, said. \u201cDemocrats need to deliver win after win after win to show voters we can govern and deserve to stay in power,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet for success, but there\u2019s certainly a recipe for disaster: failing to pass the Biden agenda.\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the child tax credit has had a major impact in alleviating poverty and held it up as an example that says Democrats, when in charge, can help Americans. \u201cThe idea of letting it expire, I think, would be horrific,\u201d he said. While Democrats battle over what provisions make it into the bill, they appear to agree unanimously that the money for kids should be extended \u2014 from centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., to progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. But the details are unclear. The House version of the bill extends the payments through 2025. That may be adjusted as lawmakers sort out how to cut down the plan's price tag to get the centrists on board. And the income threshold for who is eligible may be adjusted as Manchin has demanded additional means-testing for the various programs in the bill. \u201cThere's some differences of opinion about how to do it, and how long to fund it, etcetera. And it has to fit within the overall top line of the bill,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. \u201cBut every Dem really wants it to happen.\u201d Republicans are adamantly opposed to the program and say it should expire. \u201cThe federal government shouldn't be in the business of just handing out money because you have kids,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said. \u201cThat's ridiculous.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Democrats of \u201ctrying to build a permanent welfare class in the country,\u201d saying the child tax credit includes \u201cdistributing more borrowed money to people who don't have a need for it.\u201d Some Democrats are spoiling for that fight. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the party\u2019s House campaign arm, projected confidence that Democrats will pass the bill, extend the child cash payments and then run on them. \u201cWe're going to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact that the Republicans have opposed it at every step of the way will come back to haunt them. I believe that it's exactly that type of thing that is the anvil on which we will hammer them in 2022.\u201d Sean McElwee, a progressive pollster who has been cited by the White House, said his firm has found that voters who received the child cash payment approve of Biden's job performance by a wide margin of 66 percent to 32 percent, whereas voters who haven't gotten it split evenly with 49 percent approving and disapproving. The firm, Data for Progress, found that those who voted for then-President Donald Trump in 2020 and who receive the child tax credit register 79 percent disapproval of Biden, whereas 92 percent of those who do not receive it disapprove of the president. \u201cEnding the child tax credit would risk washing away these key persuasion gains that will be necessary to win in 2022 and 2024,\u201d McElwee said. Overall, the child cash payments are supported by 59 percent of U.S. adults, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. That includes 75 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of Republicans. Some of the states with the highest average per-month cash payments are conservative states. Progressives cite the program as an example of how government can make Americans' lives better. \u201cWe already have powerful data showing us that this tax credit is reducing hunger in America. It's providing school shoes and backpacks for kids to be able to go back to school,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u201cWe need to protect this \u2014 not just because it expires in an election year. We need to protect it because this helps American families.\u201d", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/squid-game-entertaining-world-there-s-different-feeling-south-korea-n1281119", "title": "'Squid Game' is entertaining the world. But there's a different feeling in South Korea", "subtitle": "\u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing,\" said Professor CedarBough Saeji.", "author": "By Jennifer Jett and Stella Kim", "section": null, "body": "HONG KONG \u2014 Why are South Koreans watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d? Because everyone else is. The nine-episode horror series on Netflix has hit No. 1 in 90 of the streaming service\u2019s markets around the world, including South Korea, where it was made. \u201cI got to the point where I could not hold a conversation without watching the show,\u201d said Jung Dunn, a security analyst in Seoul, the South Korean capital. But the show also strikes a nerve because it unflinchingly addresses a problem that is particularly entrenched in South Korea: debt and the never-ending struggle to pay it off. The cast of \u201cSquid Game\u201d features some of South Korea\u2019s biggest stars, including Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist, Seong Gi-hun, a hopelessly indebted father who receives a business card from a stranger offering him a way out. Along with 455 other contestants \u2014 from all walks of life but all deeply in debt too \u2014 he agrees to compete for a cash prize of 45.6 billion won (about $38 million) by playing a series of traditional Korean children\u2019s games, only to discover that elimination from each round means death. \u201cThere\u2019s this dissonance between Korean pride that this Korean show is dominating Netflix all around the world, and the discomfort with what the show appears to expose about Korea,\u201d said CedarBough Saeji, an assistant professor of Korean and East Asian studies at Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea. \u201cKoreans love to be No. 1, but No. 1 at the cost of kind of airing your dirty laundry is a somewhat different thing.\u201d That South Korea also produced \u201cParasite,\u201d the 2020 Oscar winner for best picture that also focused on themes of inequality, has probably accentuated this discomfort, Saeji said. Still, \u201cSquid Game\u201d is wildly popular in its home country. The show was released on Sept. 17 just before Chuseok, a Korean holiday similar to Thanksgiving when families gather, the perfect time for binge-watching. The surge in network traffic led one internet service provider to sue Netflix to cover its costs. The fervor has also spilled over into real life. A street vendor in Seoul who provided the makers of \u201cSquid Game\u201d with dalgona, a brittle sugar candy at the center of one of the games, told Reuters that he had seen a boom in business. Thousands of curious South Koreans also tried the eight-digit phone number that appears on the business card, which the show\u2019s makers didn\u2019t realize would reach an actual person. The owner of the number, and even people with similar numbers, have been inundated with calls and messages at all hours. On Wednesday, Netflix said it was working with the show\u2019s local production company to address the issue, including editing scenes to remove the number. Park Sae-ha, a senior studying economics at Yonsei University in Seoul, said \u201cSquid Game\u201d was \u201cspell-binding because it was so explicit and blunt.\u201d \u201cAlthough I am young, I could easily relate to the hard reality of a very competitive society,\u201d she said. That intense competitiveness may be one reason South Korea has been so successful, with a period of rapid industrialization starting in the 1960s that turned it into the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. But as in many other countries, a university degree and a white-collar job don\u2019t guarantee the financial security they used to, Saeji said. With an average income of about $42,000 a year, many Koreans now find they have to borrow to keep up. Fueled by low interest rates, household debt in South Korea has grown significantly in recent years, and is now equal to the country\u2019s annual GDP. (In the U.S., by contrast, household debt is about 80 percent of GDP.) People may rack up debt because of credit card spending, unemployment or gambling losses, but a large chunk of it is tied to real estate. Housing prices have been rising fast, especially under President Moon Jae-in, and the average price of an apartment in Seoul is nearing $1 million. Lending curbs and efforts to cool the housing market have done little to rein in household borrowing. In addition to housing, some Koreans, especially young people, borrow money to invest in cryptocurrency. Many Koreans start out by borrowing from legitimate financial institutions like banks, said Koo Se-Woong, a commentator on Korean culture based in Germany. When that avenue is exhausted, they may move on to second-tier lenders that charge higher interest. In the worst-case scenarios, he said, borrowers turn to loan shark operations that can charge triple-digit interest rates, \u201cand then you are pushed into situations from which you really cannot get out.\u201d According to some estimates, there are 400,000 Koreans in debt to loan sharks. \u201cWhen you look at the characters in the show who are participating in this game, they represent that demographic of the Koreans who are in the worst possible situation because of their personal debt,\u201d Koo said. In a recent widely shared Facebook post, Koo said he was shocked when a friend told him he was living paycheck to paycheck, despite having a good job. The friend \u201cdoesn't strike anyone as extravagant,\u201d Koo said, but struggles to afford the trappings of middle-class life: an apartment, a car and occasional travel with his wife and children. \"It's all paid for by loans, I am telling you,\" Koo said his friend told him. \"We just have no money.\" Jung, the security analyst, said the plot of \u201cSquid Game\u201d was easy to accept because \u201cit dealt with such familiar stories of debt-ridden people you come across in real life.\u201d \u201cThe story stems from a deeply rooted perception of how society looks at failure, especially individual financial failure,\u201d he said. Bankruptcy in South Korea is generally seen not as a chance to start over but as a devastating fate. That is underlined in \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Saeji said, when contestants are given the option to leave but choose to keep playing even at the risk of their lives. \u201cIn the regular world it\u2019s not just the death of their body, it\u2019s the death of their pride. It\u2019s the shame of having to be such an unsuccessful person in front of your family,\u201d she said. Viewers in South Korea say the show is all the more disturbing because it injects death and violence into playground games like Red Light, Green Light and tug of war. The show plays on childhood nostalgia \u201cand along with it the innocent times when you had no problems,\u201d said Kim Hern-sik, a pop culture critic in Seoul. \u201cYet the story tells you that escaping from reality is not the answer.\u201d \u201cSquid Game\u201d is \u201cfundamentally a Korean story, featuring games people would remember playing as kids,\u201d Don Kang, vice president of Korean content at Netflix, told NBC News in an email. \u201cSo we knew it would resonate with our members here.\u201d Its popularity in the West came as more of a surprise. But Korean cultural exports have been sweeping Asia for years, and Netflix was already betting on their growing appeal. The company is spending $500 million this year on Korean content, almost as much as it spent in the last five years. Saeji said that after decades of Western cultural influence, the success of \u201cSquid Game\u201d shows that South Korea can make a TV show with a Hollywood feel \u201cand they can do it better.\u201d While \u201cSquid Game\u201d is not the first story about a fight to the death, director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who has a film degree from the University of Southern California, made it influential in his own way, said Oh Dong-jin, a prominent film critic in South Korea. \u201cEvery movie borrows this and that from other movies. What matters, therefore, is how creatively you can borrow from different references,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, even from this standpoint, the traditional children\u2019s games the show uses make 'Squid Game' quite original.\u201d Margie Kim, a housewife in Seoul who is watching \u201cSquid Game\u201d with her family, said that while she enjoyed its intensity and pop-art-influenced visuals, the underlying messages were also important. \u201cI do feel the pain of what our society is going through,\u201d she said. The show deals with so many pressing issues, she said\u2014income inequality, youth unemployment, a rapidly aging society\u2014that it\u2019s something her entire family can relate to and talk about. \u201cSo many middle-class, ordinary people live with so much debt,\u201d she said. \u201cI could totally empathize with people who joined the game.\u201d Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, and Stella Kim reported from Los Angeles.", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/working-companies-owned-well-heeled-private-equity-firms-can-mean-n1281146", "title": "Working for companies owned by well-heeled private-equity firms can mean lower wages for employees", "subtitle": "Workers at some fast-food chains owned by public firms are getting better wages now. It\u2019s a different story at restaurants owned by private-equity firms.", "author": "By Gretchen Morgenson", "section": null, "body": "Alma Jordan, a certified nursing assistant at the Marcella Center nursing home in Burlington, New Jersey, respected the residents she cared for there over the past 16 years. They were like family, she said, and she believes they\u2019ve appreciated her attentiveness, especially during Covid-19. Not so, the nursing home\u2019s new owner, Jordan said. After Complete Care Management, the largest for-profit nursing home operator in New Jersey, took over the 150-bed Marcella Center in April, it slashed worker benefits, she and other employees as well as a representative from their union told NBC News. Amid the pandemic, Jordan\u2019s paid holidays were reduced, and her monthly health insurance costs more than tripled, she said. The company stopped contributing to the employee pension, replacing it with a 401(k) plan that had no employer match or contribution. Complete Care took away vision insurance and stopped a reimbursement program covering employee education costs, so Jordan, 45, won\u2019t be able to recoup money she spent working toward a degree to become a licensed practical nurse. \u201cI put all my effort into this company, and someone else took over and they don\u2019t want to give us what we deserve,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s business. It\u2019s not about the staff and the residents. It\u2019s only about making profits.\u201d In late September, Jordan quit her position at the facility. The reduced benefits and deteriorating work conditions got to be too much, she said. When Complete Care came in, Jordan and other Marcella workers were operating under a union contract struck with the facility\u2019s previous owner. Complete Care did away with that contract, which also covered four other unionized New Jersey nursing facilities it recently acquired, according to the Service Employees International Union. Complete Care owns 61 facilities in eight states, including Connecticut, Maryland and Wisconsin. It is backed by a private-equity firm called Peace Capital in Lakewood, New Jersey, whose principal owner is Sam Stein. Jordan and her fellow workers are not alone in experiencing reduced circumstances after their company is taken over by a private-equity firm. The new titans of finance, these firms use large pools of debt \u2014 typically raised in what's called the leveraged loan market \u2014 to acquire companies they hope to resell in a few years at a profit. Among companies raising money in this loan market during the past three years, debt levels at private-equity-backed entities were at least 30 percent higher than debt levels at companies not backed by private equity, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. But the heavy debt loads they take on, combined with pressure to flip acquired companies quickly, increases the likelihood that private-equity firms will have to cut costs in the operations that they buy. Often, the first to the chopping block is the company\u2019s workforce. A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research lays this out. Researchers analyzed almost 10,000 debt-fueled buyouts between 1980 and 2013 and found that employment fell by 13 percent when a private-equity firm took over a public company. Employment declined by even more \u2014 16 percent \u2014 when private equity acquired a unit or division of a company. Eileen Appelbaum is an economist and co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, and co-author of \"Private Equity at Work: When Wall Street Manages Main Street.\" Her study of private equity has led her to conclude that the industry\u2019s growing clout is not only a concern for workers, but also has the potential to harm the nation\u2019s broader economy. \u201cYou have a lot more ownership of productive resources by investors who don\u2019t know an industry, don\u2019t understand the value of skilled workers and who are just in it to make their profit and get out,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cThat erodes productivity.\u201d Almost 12 million employees, or roughly 7 percent of the U.S. labor force, work for private-equity-backed businesses, according to the American Investment Council, an industry lobbying group. These companies generated about 6.5 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product last year, the group said. The council said private-equity firms create jobs, support businesses and help provide comfortable retirements for pensioners invested in the strategy. A spokeswoman for Complete Care echoed this view. She said the company is committed to the long-term viability of its facilities, adding in a statement: \u201cWe offer a comprehensive health plan and competitive benefits, and our facilities are known as great places to work.\u201d The company is negotiating a new union contract, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, though, care at the Marcella facility is declining, Jordan said, days after she quit. \u201cWe were very short-staffed,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think the residents pick up on that because it takes longer to answer a call.\u201d In a statement, a spokesperson for Complete Care said, \u201cComplete Care at Marcella consistently maintains state mandated ratios. ... We take whatever measures necessary to ensure that we have proper staffing to meet the needs of those in our care, including bringing in agency staff and offering bonuses as needed.\" Private equity is a sophisticated investment strategy that has grown furiously in recent years. At the end of last year, assets under management at the firms worldwide stood at $5 trillion, up from $1.5 trillion over the past decade, according to Preqin, a financial data provider. The number of funds devoted to these activities has more than doubled during that period, and last year, private-equity firms paid some $600 billion to acquire companies, up from $250 billion 10 years earlier. Private-equity firms began their climb to power in the 1980s; then they were known as leveraged buyout shops, because of the debt they use. The $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988 by private-equity giant Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts brought such deals to center stage. In recent years, as prevailing interest rates collapsed, private-equity operations have been able to take on greater amounts of low-cost debt to make their acquisitions. Through Sept. 27, for example, $472 billion of leveraged loans were issued, up from $237 billion issued during the same period in 2019, according to LCD of S&P Global. Outside investors, such as public pension funds and endowments, pour money into these takeover deals in the hopes of generating high returns. But recently, as the stock market has roared, outsize returns in private equity have all but vanished, academic studies show, and they are now in line with overall market performance. Nevertheless, more companies are owned by private-equity firms now than trade on the nation\u2019s stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, private-equity firms\u2019 rising dominance has generated immense wealth for their executives. The value of Sam Stein's holdings in Complete Care could not be determined and the company declined to provide it, but it is almost certainly dwarfed by those of Stephen Schwarzman, head of Blackstone Group. A close adviser to Donald Trump during his presidency, Schwarzman is worth $35 billion, according to Forbes magazine, up from $15 billion in 2020. Private equity also benefited from recent government interventions related to the Covid pandemic, documents show. At least $5 billion in federal bailout money went to companies backed by large and well-capitalized private-equity firms, according to a recent report from Americans for Financial Reform. Last year, the Federal Reserve Board launched an unprecedented $750 billion program to prop up the corporate bond market, where many of these firms raise money for their buyouts. Among the bonds purchased by the Fed, documents show, were those issued by Blackstone and another private-equity giant, Apollo Global Management, founded by Leon Black. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently testified that the agency would increase its scrutiny on fee disclosures and conflicts of interest among private funds, to ensure their practices don't put investors in these strategies at a disadvantage. And Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a late September memo outlining the agency's priorities that \"the growing role of private equity\" invites an examination of how these firms' business models \"may facilitate unfair methods of competition and consumer protection violations.\" Finally, the Democrats\u2019 proposed tax increase on capital gains may crimp private-equity executives\u2019 earnings. A key reason many of these executives have been able to amass such fortunes is that so much of their earnings are taxed as capital gains with a top rate of 20 percent, not at the higher 37 percent rate that can apply to income. This is a benefit they've tapped for decades, often allowing them to pay a lower tax rate on earnings than a secretary or a teacher might. One of the nation\u2019s biggest private-equity employers is Roark Capital of Atlanta. It owns Inspire Brands \u2014 parent company to an array of fast-food chains that includes Arby\u2019s, Dunkin\u2019, Baskin-Robbins and Sonic \u2014 and other brands such as Cinnabon and Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee. NBC News estimates that more than 700,000 people work at Inspire Brands, many at independently owned franchise stores. Roark is named for the libertarian protagonist in \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d by Ayn Rand, whose life \u201cexemplified the qualities of independence and integrity,\u201d the company\u2019s website said. One of libertarianism's basic tenets is limited government, but three dozen companies owned by Roark obtained $183 million in federal assistance under the CARES Act, according to the Americans for Financial Reform report. Asked whether this acceptance of government funding ran counter to a limited government stance, Roark declined to comment through a spokeswoman. Zella Roberts, a recent graduate of Warren Wilson College near Asheville, North Carolina, worked as a carhop at a Sonic Drive-In earlier this year to help pay tuition. Her all-in pay plummeted during the pandemic, Roberts told NBC News, because customers\u2019 cash usage fell and Sonic did not allow tips on credit cards. Roberts said she and some colleagues sent an email to Roark Capital \"explaining the conditions that Sonic workers experience. The big ask was to put pressure on Sonic corporate to make these changes.\" She said she never heard back about that or other messages sent to Neal Aronson, managing partner and founder of Roark Capital. Aronson is the controlling owner of Roark, regulatory filings show, which has $18.6 billion in assets under management. Through a spokeswoman, Aronson declined to comment. In January, after Roberts had collected 7,800 signatures on a petition asking Roark to change its policy, the company allowed tips on credit card orders placed through its app. An improvement, Roberts acknowledged, but such orders are a small percentage of those made via credit cards, she pointed out. The Inspire Brands spokesman said barring tips on credit cards \u201cis a technology limitation that we inherited when we purchased the brand\u201d in 2018. \u201cWe are now working on implementing the credit card tipping capability,\u201d he said. Inspire Brands has also worked to battle the Raise the Wage Act, which has been introduced in Congress every year since 2017 and would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour among workers like Roberts. In March, Inspire sent a memo to franchise owners highlighting its lobbying success in opposing the change. Describing its efforts, Inspire said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you\u2019re on the menu, and you can guarantee your opponents are eating!\u201d Chris Fuller, a spokesman for Inspire Brands, said the company fought the national minimum wage legislation because \u201cwe don\u2019t support a one-size-fits-all approach to the minimum wage. We believe in letting the local markets dictate.\u201d He added: \u201cMore than 90 percent of our team members at corporate-owned restaurants are above the state or local minimum wage.\u201d Some Inspire Brands workers have taken matters into their own hands. This summer, Matthew Honeycutt, 18, was working at an Arby\u2019s in Charlotte, North Carolina, making $9.50 an hour as a shift manager. He supports an 8-month-old son. On July 20, he and a group of workers walked off the job seeking a pay raise, forcing managers to close the Arby\u2019s store two hours early, Honeycutt said. That got management\u2019s attention, he said. \u201cThe strike was on a Tuesday, and it was about Thursday when he started getting the raises out,\u201d Honeycutt said of his boss, who gave him a 50-cents-an-hour raise. \"Every kind of worker you can think of is working so hard, but they're not getting paid what they\u2019re worth.\" Honeycutt\u2019s boss did not respond to a voicemail message seeking comment. In mid-September, Honeycutt quit his job at Arby's for a higher-paying position elsewhere. While Inspire Brands fights against a higher minimum wage, some other restaurant companies owned by publicly traded companies are taking a different approach. They say increasing worker pay is good for business. In February, Robert Verostek, the chief financial officer of restaurant chain Denny\u2019s, told investors that paying a higher wage to its workers in California had resulted in \u201cnot just positive sales, but positive guest traffic.\u201d And in May, McDonald's began increasing pay by 10 percent for almost 37,000 workers in company-owned stores. Shift managers like Honeycutt, who earned $10 at Arby\u2019s, are earning between $15 and $20 an hour depending on the location, McDonald\u2019s said. Sean Dunlop, an equity analyst at Morningstar Research, said Inspire Brands is a well-managed company. But increasing pay and benefits among workers is an industry trend it won't be able to resist. \"As you\u2019re thinking about bigger chains, not only are they making a broader push to a $15 average wage at restaurants, you\u2019ve also seen them offer tuition assistance, paid time off, retention bonuses and referral bonuses as they\u2019ve been trying to attract workers,\" Dunlop said. \"Inspire Brands, if they want to compete, are going to be forced to raise wages. They're going to have to, whether they want to or not.\"", "list": null}, {"link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/silicon-valley-area-food-banks-strain-under-growing-logistical-needs-n1281047", "title": "Silicon Valley area food banks strain under growing logistical needs of poverty", "subtitle": "\u201cInfrastructure requirements have sorely taxed the charitable food system at a time when demand is still extraordinarily high,\u201d one expert said.", "author": "By Cyrus Farivar", "section": null, "body": "RICHMOND, Calif. \u2014 On a recent unseasonably warm October day, dozens of Californians gathered at a food distribution site on a vast, unshaded blacktop space behind an elementary school. In one hour, 193 people waited patiently to fill their carts and shopping bags with produce like bell peppers, apples, onions and squash from the side of a massive truck. \u201cThat\u2019s a record for this year,\u201d said Matthew Durkin, 30, the mobile distribution supervisor, while nodding at the clients and noting that he usually sees only about 160 people. \u201cIt means there\u2019s an increased need.\u201d Durkin, of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, says that while demand for free food has slowed slightly from the start of the pandemic, people are still hungry. \u201cWe have seen another jump in numbers within the last few months. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, adding that many clients have told them how much they fear returning to work. \"They are concerned about Covid-19 surges, as so many of us are, and some of them may need to stay available for unexpected changes in child care and school due to Covid exposures or cases.\u201d More than 18 months into the pandemic, San Francisco Bay Area nonprofit organizations, from food banks to shelters for domestic violence victims, say that they are seeing more demand for their services than they ever saw before the pandemic. Even now, there are still two members of the California National Guard working at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties\u2019 central warehouse in Fairfield. As the pandemic drags on, these support facilities are also struggling with supply chain problems to meet the seemingly endless demand. It presents even more challenges as supplies and workers grow more scarce. Joel Sjostrom, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano counties, has watched the food bank\u2019s demand grow to 300,000 people at the height of the pandemic from 178,000 before the pandemic began. He is now still trying to find support for 240,000 clients each month. Almost immediately after the March 2020 shelter-in-place order was instituted, he said, his organization lost 35 percent of its volunteer workforce because it depends so heavily on older volunteers who were scared to work before they were vaccinated. He had to call in members of the California National Guard, two of which remain. \u201cTo meet those volume increases, we have had to step up facilities and transportation,\u201d Sjostrom added. \u201cI had heard of the National Guard being helpful to others in Southern California.\u201d At one point, there were as many as 25 soldiers working to help this one bank. In California, the National Guard, as of Thursday, still had 140 soldiers deployed to food banks across 16 counties, down from a high of 767 in April 2020, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan M. Shiroma, a California National Guard spokesperson. But the National Guard is gradually trying to cut those numbers back and deploy these workers to other missions. In addition to help from the National Guard, Sjostrom has hired more full-time staff. But even now, even with 16 drivers, he still would like four more \u201cClass A\u201d drivers who can operate big rig trucks. In order to stay competitive with other outfits that employ drivers, he said he has had to raise his rates from $28 per hour to $30 per hour. \u201cIt\u2019s truly market pressure,\u201d Sjostrom said. \u201cAmazon has ads out, as does Hello Fresh, and driver demand is everywhere.\u201d", "list": null}]
